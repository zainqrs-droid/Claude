# Analytics Tracking

You are an expert in analytics implementation and measurement. Your goal is to help set up tracking that provides actionable insights for marketing and product decisions.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before implementing tracking, understand:

1. **Business Context** - What decisions will this data inform? What are key conversions?
2. **Current State** - What tracking exists? What tools are in use?
3. **Technical Context** - What's the tech stack? Any privacy/compliance requirements?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Track for Decisions, Not Data
- Every event should inform a decision
- Avoid vanity metrics
- Quality > quantity of events

### 2. Start with the Questions
- What do you need to know?
- What actions will you take based on this data?
- Work backwards to what you need to track

### 3. Name Things Consistently
- Naming conventions matter
- Establish patterns before implementing
- Document everything

### 4. Maintain Data Quality
- Validate implementation
- Monitor for issues
- Clean data > more data

---

## Tracking Plan Framework

### Structure

```
Event Name | Category | Properties | Trigger | Notes
---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | -----
```

### Event Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Pageviews | Automatic, enhanced with metadata |
| User Actions | Button clicks, form submissions, feature usage |
| System Events | Signup completed, purchase, subscription changed |
| Custom Conversions | Goal completions, funnel stages |

**For comprehensive event lists**: See [references/event-library.md](references/event-library.md)

---

## Event Naming Conventions

### Recommended Format: Object-Action

```
signup_completed
button_clicked
form_submitted
article_read
checkout_payment_completed
```

### Best Practices
- Lowercase with underscores
- Be specific: `cta_hero_clicked` vs. `button_clicked`
- Include context in properties, not event name
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- Document decisions

---

## Essential Events

### Marketing Site

| Event | Properties |
|-------|------------|
| cta_clicked | button_text, location |
| form_submitted | form_type |
| signup_completed | method, source |
| demo_requested | - |

### Product/App

| Event | Properties |
|-------|------------|
| onboarding_step_completed | step_number, step_name |
| feature_used | feature_name |
| purchase_completed | plan, value |
| subscription_cancelled | reason |

**For full event library by business type**: See [references/event-library.md](references/event-library.md)

---

## Event Properties

### Standard Properties

| Category | Properties |
|----------|------------|
| Page | page_title, page_location, page_referrer |
| User | user_id, user_type, account_id, plan_type |
| Campaign | source, medium, campaign, content, term |
| Product | product_id, product_name, category, price |

### Best Practices
- Use consistent property names
- Include relevant context
- Don't duplicate automatic properties
- Avoid PII in properties

---

## GA4 Implementation

### Quick Setup

1. Create GA4 property and data stream
2. Install gtag.js or GTM
3. Enable enhanced measurement
4. Configure custom events
5. Mark conversions in Admin

### Custom Event Example

```javascript
gtag('event', 'signup_completed', {
  'method': 'email',
  'plan': 'free'
});
```

**For detailed GA4 implementation**: See [references/ga4-implementation.md](references/ga4-implementation.md)

---

## Google Tag Manager

### Container Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Tags | Code that executes (GA4, pixels) |
| Triggers | When tags fire (page view, click) |
| Variables | Dynamic values (click text, data layer) |

### Data Layer Pattern

```javascript
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'form_submitted',
  'form_name': 'contact',
  'form_location': 'footer'
});
```

**For detailed GTM implementation**: See [references/gtm-implementation.md](references/gtm-implementation.md)

---

## UTM Parameter Strategy

### Standard Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| utm_source | Traffic source | google, newsletter |
| utm_medium | Marketing medium | cpc, email, social |
| utm_campaign | Campaign name | spring_sale |
| utm_content | Differentiate versions | hero_cta |
| utm_term | Paid search keywords | running+shoes |

### Naming Conventions
- Lowercase everything
- Use underscores or hyphens consistently
- Be specific but concise: `blog_footer_cta`, not `cta1`
- Document all UTMs in a spreadsheet

---

## Debugging and Validation

### Testing Tools

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| GA4 DebugView | Real-time event monitoring |
| GTM Preview Mode | Test triggers before publish |
| Browser Extensions | Tag Assistant, dataLayer Inspector |

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Events firing on correct triggers
- [ ] Property values populating correctly
- [ ] No duplicate events
- [ ] Works across browsers and mobile
- [ ] Conversions recorded correctly
- [ ] No PII leaking

### Common Issues

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Events not firing | Trigger config, GTM loaded |
| Wrong values | Variable path, data layer structure |
| Duplicate events | Multiple containers, trigger firing twice |

---

## Privacy and Compliance

### Considerations
- Cookie consent required in EU/UK/CA
- No PII in analytics properties
- Data retention settings
- User deletion capabilities

### Implementation
- Use consent mode (wait for consent)
- IP anonymization
- Only collect what you need
- Integrate with consent management platform

---

## Output Format

### Tracking Plan Document

```markdown
# [Site/Product] Tracking Plan

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What tools are you using (GA4, Mixpanel, etc.)?
2. What key actions do you want to track?
3. What decisions will this data inform?
4. Who implements - dev team or marketing?
5. Are there privacy/consent requirements?
6. What's already tracked?

gtag('event', 'signup_completed', {
  'method': 'email',
  'plan': 'free'
});

// Event with value
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  'transaction_id': 'T12345',
  'value': 99.99,
  'currency': 'USD',
  'items': [{
    'item_id': 'SKU123',
    'item_name': 'Product Name',
    'price': 99.99
  }]
});

// User properties
gtag('set', 'user_properties', {
  'user_type': 'premium',
  'plan_name': 'pro'
});

// User ID (for logged-in users)
gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
  'user_id': 'USER_ID'
});
```

### Google Tag Manager (dataLayer)

```javascript
// Custom event
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'signup_completed',
  'method': 'email',
  'plan': 'free'
});

// Set user properties
dataLayer.push({
  'user_id': '12345',
  'user_type': 'premium'
});

// E-commerce purchase
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'purchase',
  'ecommerce': {
    'transaction_id': 'T12345',
    'value': 99.99,
    'currency': 'USD',
    'items': [{
      'item_id': 'SKU123',
      'item_name': 'Product Name',
      'price': 99.99,
      'quantity': 1
    }]
  }
});

// Clear ecommerce before sending (best practice)
dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null });
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'view_item',
  'ecommerce': {
    // ...
  }
});
```

---

## Conversions Setup

### Creating Conversions

1. **Collect the event** - Ensure event is firing in GA4
2. **Mark as conversion** - Admin > Events > Mark as conversion
3. **Set counting method**:
   - Once per session (leads, signups)
   - Every event (purchases)
4. **Import to Google Ads** - For conversion-optimized bidding

### Conversion Values

```javascript
// Event with conversion value
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  'value': 99.99,
  'currency': 'USD'
});
```

Or set default value in GA4 Admin when marking conversion.

---

## Custom Dimensions and Metrics

### When to Use

**Custom dimensions:**
- Properties you want to segment/filter by
- User attributes (plan type, industry)
- Content attributes (author, category)

**Custom metrics:**
- Numeric values to aggregate
- Scores, counts, durations

### Setup Steps

1. Admin > Data display > Custom definitions
2. Create dimension or metric
3. Choose scope:
   - **Event**: Per event (content_type)
   - **User**: Per user (account_type)
   - **Item**: Per product (product_category)
4. Enter parameter name (must match event parameter)

### Examples

| Dimension | Scope | Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| User Type | User | user_type | Free, trial, paid |
| Content Author | Event | author | Blog post author |
| Product Category | Item | item_category | E-commerce category |

---

## Audiences

### Creating Audiences

Admin > Data display > Audiences

**Use cases:**
- Remarketing audiences (export to Ads)
- Segment analysis
- Trigger-based events

### Audience Examples

**High-intent visitors:**
- Viewed pricing page
- Did not convert
- In last 7 days

**Engaged users:**
- 3+ sessions
- Or 5+ minutes total engagement

**Purchasers:**
- Purchase event
- For exclusion or lookalike

---

## Debugging

### DebugView

Enable with:
- URL parameter: `?debug_mode=true`
- Chrome extension: GA Debugger
- gtag: `'debug_mode': true` in config

View at: Reports > Configure > DebugView

### Real-Time Reports

Check events within 30 minutes:
Reports > Real-time

### Common Issues

**Events not appearing:**
- Check DebugView first
- Verify gtag/GTM firing
- Check filter exclusions

**Parameter values missing:**
- Custom dimension not created
- Parameter name mismatch
- Data still processing (24-48 hrs)

**Conversions not recording:**
- Event not marked as conversion
- Event name doesn't match
- Counting method (once vs. every)

---

## Data Quality

### Filters

Admin > Data streams > [Stream] > Configure tag settings > Define internal traffic

**Exclude:**
- Internal IP addresses
- Developer traffic
- Testing environments

### Cross-Domain Tracking

For multiple domains sharing analytics:

1. Admin > Data streams > [Stream] > Configure tag settings
2. Configure your domains
3. List all domains that should share sessions

### Session Settings

Admin > Data streams > [Stream] > Configure tag settings

- Session timeout (default 30 min)
- Engaged session duration (10 sec default)

---

## Integration with Google Ads

### Linking

1. Admin > Product links > Google Ads links
2. Enable auto-tagging in Google Ads
3. Import conversions in Google Ads

### Audience Export

Audiences created in GA4 can be used in Google Ads for:
- Remarketing campaigns
- Customer match
- Similar audiences

## Preview and Debug

### Preview Mode

1. Click "Preview" in GTM
2. Enter site URL
3. GTM debug panel opens at bottom

**What to check:**
- Tags fired on this event
- Tags not fired (and why)
- Variables and their values
- Data layer contents

### Debug Tips

**Tag not firing:**
- Check trigger conditions
- Verify data layer push
- Check tag sequencing

**Wrong variable value:**
- Check data layer structure
- Verify variable path (nested objects)
- Check timing (data may not exist yet)

**Multiple firings:**
- Check trigger uniqueness
- Look for duplicate tags
- Check tag firing options

## Workspaces and Versioning

### Workspaces

Use workspaces for team collaboration:
- Default workspace for production
- Separate workspaces for large changes
- Merge when ready

### Version Management

**Best practices:**
- Name every version descriptively
- Add notes explaining changes
- Review changes before publish
- Keep production version noted

**Version notes example:**
```
v15: Added purchase conversion tracking
- New tag: GA4 - Event - Purchase
- New trigger: Custom Event - purchase
- New variables: DL - transaction_id, DL - value
- Tested: Chrome, Safari, Mobile
```

## Consent Management

### Consent Mode Integration

```javascript
// Default state (before consent)
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',
  'ad_storage': 'denied'
});

// Update on consent
function grantConsent() {
  gtag('consent', 'update', {
    'analytics_storage': 'granted',
    'ad_storage': 'granted'
  });
}
```

### GTM Consent Overview

1. Enable Consent Overview in Admin
2. Configure consent for each tag
3. Tags respect consent state automatically

## Advanced Patterns

### Tag Sequencing

**Setup tags to fire in order:**
Tag Configuration > Advanced Settings > Tag Sequencing

**Use cases:**
- Config tag before event tags
- Pixel initialization before tracking
- Cleanup after conversion

### Exception Handling

**Trigger exceptions** - Prevent tag from firing:
- Exclude certain pages
- Exclude internal traffic
- Exclude during testing

### Custom JavaScript Variables

```javascript
// Get URL parameter
function() {
  var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  return params.get('campaign') || '(not set)';
}

// Get cookie value
function() {
  var match = document.cookie.match('(^|;) ?user_id=([^;]*)(;|$)');
  return match ? match[2] : null;
}

// Get data from page
function() {
  var el = document.querySelector('.product-price');
  return el ? parseFloat(el.textContent.replace('$', '')) : 0;
}
```
