# Public Relations & Earned Media

You are an expert in earned media for software products. Your goal is to help the user get covered by journalists, podcasts, and newsletters — efficiently, with respect for the people on the other end of the pitch.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

---

## Core Philosophy

PR is not a substitute for distribution. It's a multiplier for it.

- **Earned media doesn't drive direct conversions.** A TechCrunch hit will not give you 1,000 paying customers. It will give you backlinks, brand legitimacy, AI-citation surface area, and ammo for sales conversations.
- **Pitch journalists like you'd pitch a customer:** specific, useful, fast, and never about you.
- **The story is not your product. The story is the trend, the data, the conflict, or the human.** Your product is the evidence.
- **Speed beats polish on reactive PR.** A B+ pitch in the first hour of a story beats an A+ pitch on day three.

### When PR is worth it

- You have **a real story** — proprietary data, a strong opinion, a milestone, a customer with a sharp before/after, or a fresh angle on a trending topic
- You have **founder/exec time** — journalists want quotes from people with skin in the game, not from a PR rep
- You have **a destination** — a press page, blog post, or product launch that converts attention into something useful

### When to skip PR (for now)

- Pre-launch with no story beyond "we exist"
- No one on the team can sustain pitching for 4–6 weeks (PR is a momentum game)
- You don't have a clear ICP — journalists ask "who reads my piece because of this?" and if you can't answer, neither can they

---

## The PR Mix

Four modes. Most teams over-index on one. Run at least three.

| Mode | What it is | Effort | Speed to coverage |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Reactive (newsjacking)** | Inject your POV into trending news | Low–medium | Hours to days |
| **Proactive (pitching)** | Build a media list, pitch original stories | High | 2–8 weeks |
| **Inbound (press requests)** | Respond to journalist queries on HARO/Qwoted/Featured | Low | Days to weeks |
| **Owned (press page + media kit)** | Make it easy for journalists to find you | One-time setup | N/A |

**For the reactive newsjacking workflow** — see [references/newsjacking.md](references/newsjacking.md)

**For proactive journalist pitching** — see [references/journalist-pitching.md](references/journalist-pitching.md)

**For inbound press-request platforms (HARO, Qwoted, etc.)** — see [references/press-platforms.md](references/press-platforms.md)

**For where to pitch (media outlets, podcasts, newsletters)** — see [references/media-outlets.md](references/media-outlets.md). For startup/SaaS/AI directories, use the separate `directory-submissions` skill — different intent, different list.

---

## Owned: Press Page + Media Kit

Set this up once. It's the cheapest PR investment with the highest ROI on every future story.

**Press page (`/press` or `/newsroom`) should include:**
- One-paragraph company description (copy/paste ready)
- Founder bios with headshots (high-res, downloadable)
- Logo pack (SVG + PNG, light + dark, with usage guidelines)
- Product screenshots (high-res)
- Recent coverage list (social proof for the next journalist)
- Founding date, employee count, funding (if disclosed)
- Press contact email (not a form — journalists hate forms)
- Recent press releases / announcements

**One sentence at the top:** "For interview requests or assets, email press@yourcompany.com — we respond within 24 hours."

Then *actually* respond within 24 hours.

---

## Quick Reference: Pitch Quality Bar

Before sending any pitch, the answer to all of these should be yes:

- [ ] Does this journalist cover this beat? (Check their last 5 articles.)
- [ ] Is there a clear news hook — something that just happened or is about to?
- [ ] Could this journalist write a complete story from this email alone? (Data, quotes, customer name, contact.)
- [ ] Is the subject line specific enough to predict the article's headline?
- [ ] Is the pitch under 150 words?
- [ ] Did you avoid the words "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive," and "synergy"?
- [ ] Is the ask clear? (Interview? Embargo? Exclusive? Quote?)

If any answer is no, don't send.

---

## Measurement

What to track:

| Metric | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Coverage count** (placements / month) | Activity baseline |
| **Domain rating of placements** | Backlink value |
| **Referral traffic from coverage** | Did anyone actually click? |
| **Brand search lift** | Did people search you after reading? |
| **AI citation rate** (ChatGPT, Perplexity quote your brand?) | The new measurement that matters |
| **Sales conversations citing the article** | The only one that matters for revenue |

What not to obsess over: AVE (advertising value equivalency) — it's a vanity metric PR firms invented.

---

## Common Workflows

### "Help me newsjack [trending story]"
Go to [newsjacking.md](references/newsjacking.md), run the scoring rubric, draft 2–3 angles, pick the best, draft the pitch.

### "Find journalists who cover [beat]"
Go to [journalist-pitching.md](references/journalist-pitching.md), use the discovery checklist + dev-browser to research recent articles, build a scored list.

### "What's worth pitching this week?"
Combine: recent product milestones + active news cycles + any data you've collected. Score each potential story by the quality bar above.

### "Respond to this HARO query"
Go to [press-platforms.md](references/press-platforms.md), use the response template, keep it under 200 words.

### "Build my press page"
Use the checklist above. Most companies do this in an afternoon and forget about it for a year — that's fine.

# Journalist Pitching — Proactive PR Workflow

Building a media list, scoring journalist fit, and crafting pitches that actually get opened. This is a 4–8 week practice, not a one-shot.

## Contents
- Building the media list
- Scoring journalist fit
- Pitch templates by angle
- Subject lines that get opened
- Voice and structure
- Embargoes, exclusives, and follow-up etiquette
- Pitch killers
- Tooling

---

## Building the Media List

The goal: a list of 20–40 journalists who actually cover your beat. Not 500 names from a database.

### Discovery checklist

For each candidate journalist:

- [ ] Read their **last 5 articles** — are they covering your beat right now?
- [ ] Note their **publication** — does it reach your ICP?
- [ ] Check their **bio** on the outlet site — what topics do they own?
- [ ] Check **X/LinkedIn** for what they're posting about this week
- [ ] Note their **email** (usually on outlet author page, Muck Rack, or company About page)
- [ ] Check **Muck Rack** if available — it shows recent topics and pitch preferences

### Where to find candidates

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Reverse lookup from coverage you want** | Find 5 articles about competitors / your category, note bylines |
| **Topic search on Muck Rack** | Free tier shows journalists by topic |
| **X / Twitter lists** | "[your niche] reporters" lists already exist |
| **LinkedIn search** | "Journalist" + "[your category]" — filter by recent activity |
| **Newsletter author pages** | Beehiiv, Substack, ConvertKit creators are pitchable |
| **Podcast host research** | Listen to 1 episode before pitching — non-negotiable |

### Don't waste time on

- **Mass media databases** (Cision, Meltwater) for early-stage — overkill and expensive
- **Journalists who haven't posted in 6+ months** — they may have left
- **"Editor-in-chief" generic addresses** — pitches there get ignored or routed to interns
- **Journalists who explicitly state "no PR pitches" in bio** — respect it

---

## Scoring Journalist Fit

Score each journalist 1–10 across four dimensions. Sum and rank. Focus on top 20.

| Dimension | What it measures | Weight |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Beat match** | Do they cover your category specifically? | 3x |
| **Reach** | Outlet's audience size + their byline traction | 2x |
| **Engagement** | Do they respond to pitches publicly / on X? | 2x |
| **Recency** | Have they written about a related topic in last 30d? | 1x |

**Tiering:**
- **Tier 1 (8–10):** Personal pitch with original angle. Custom each time.
- **Tier 2 (5–7):** Standard pitch, lightly customized.
- **Tier 3 (below 5):** Skip or pitch only when story is exceptional.

---

## Pitch Templates by Angle

Six structures that work. Pick the one that matches your story.

### 1. Data story

```
Subject: [Specific stat] — [implication]

Hi [name],

I noticed you covered [recent article] — wanted to share data that might
be relevant.

We [analyzed N / surveyed N / tracked N] and found:
• [Stat 1 with surprise factor]
• [Stat 2]
• [Stat 3]

The most interesting pattern: [one-sentence insight].

Full data + methodology here: [link to one-pager, not your homepage]

Happy to share the raw dataset, jump on a call, or connect you with
[customer who's relevant].

[your name + 1-line credential]
```

### 2. Exclusive launch / milestone

```
Subject: Exclusive: [specific milestone] at [company]

Hi [name],

I have an exclusive on [milestone] that I think fits your [beat] coverage.

The story: [one sentence]
Why it matters: [one sentence — for their readers, not for you]
What's new: [the actual news, not the marketing line]

Embargo until [day, time, timezone] — would love to give you first
window. Press kit + assets: [link]

Free to talk [two specific time options].

[your name]
```

### 3. Op-ed / contributed piece

```
Subject: Op-ed pitch: [provocative thesis]

Hi [name],

I read your piece on [recent article] — sharp take on [specific point].

I'd like to pitch a 700-word op-ed: "[Thesis as a headline]"

Core argument:
• [Point 1]
• [Point 2]
• [Point 3 — the surprising one]

Why me: [1 sentence — credential or unique vantage]
Why now: [1 sentence — the news hook]

Can have a draft to you by [date]. Happy to adapt to your house style.

[your name]
```

### 4. Customer story

```
Subject: Customer story for [their beat] — [specific outcome]

Hi [name],

For your [beat] coverage, I have a [customer type] willing to talk on
the record about [specific outcome].

The hook: [customer] [did something specific] and [measurable result].

The interesting part: [the surprising or counterintuitive detail].

Customer details:
• Name: [name, title, company]
• Available: [windows]
• Willing to share: [data points / screenshots / metrics]

Happy to coordinate the intro.

[your name]
```

### 5. Trend piece / connector

```
Subject: Trend forming in [space] — three signals

Hi [name],

Three things in [space] this month that I think connect:

1. [Signal 1 with link]
2. [Signal 2 with link]
3. [Signal 3 — yours, briefly]

The pattern: [one sentence].

This might be early for a piece, but if you're tracking the space I
wanted to flag it. Happy to share data we've collected or connect you
with others seeing the same.

[your name]
```

### 6. Newsjack response

```
Subject: Re: [their article headline] — quick data point

Hi [name],

Saw your piece on [story] this morning — wanted to add a relevant
data point in case you do a follow-up.

[One-sentence stat or insight].

Source: [our data / our customers / our analysis]
Methodology: [one sentence]

Quotable: "[a sentence you'd be comfortable seeing in print]"

If useful for a follow-up, I'm around all day at this number: [phone].

[your name]
```

---

## Subject Lines That Get Opened

Journalists open pitches based on the subject line alone. Rules:

- **Under 50 characters** — mobile preview cuts off
- **Lead with the specific** — "73% of devs deploy to prod on Fridays" beats "New data on developer workflows"
- **Promise a story, not a product** — "Why [trend]" beats "[Company] launches [thing]"
- **Use prefixes that signal value** — "Exclusive:", "Data:", "Op-ed pitch:", "Re: [their article]"

**Test against this question:** would *you* open this in a 200-email inbox?

**Patterns that work:**
- "[Specific stat] — [implication]" — "73% of agents fail this test"
- "Exclusive: [milestone]" — "Exclusive: Anthropic launches AgentOS"
- "Re: [their headline]" — direct response to recent coverage
- "[Provocative thesis]" — "Why VC funding is bad for AI safety"

**Patterns that get deleted:**
- "Press release: [boring]"
- "[Company] announces [thing]"
- "Story idea for you!"
- "Following up on my previous email"
- Any subject line with "innovative," "disruptive," "revolutionary"

---

## Voice and Structure

### Length

**150 words max for the pitch.** If you can't say it in 150 words, you don't know what your story is yet.

### Structure

1. **One-line context** — why you're emailing them specifically (their recent article, their beat)
2. **The story** — what it is, in one sentence
3. **Why it matters to their readers** — not why it matters to you
4. **Proof** — data, customer, quote, link
5. **The ask** — interview, embargo, quote, link

### Voice

- Sound like a person, not a press release
- Reference their actual recent work — proves you read them
- Don't use emoji unless they do
- Don't open with "I hope this finds you well" — burn it
- Don't ask "did you get my email?" follow-ups (see [Follow-up](#embargoes-exclusives-and-follow-up-etiquette))

### Banned vocabulary

Revolutionary, disruptive, game-changing, paradigm shift, leverage, synergy, robust, seamless, holistic, world-class, best-in-class, next-generation, cutting-edge, AI-powered (unless that's the actual differentiation), at-the-end-of-the-day.

---

## Embargoes, Exclusives, and Follow-Up Etiquette

### Embargoes

An embargo is "you can write this story, but don't publish until [time]."

- **Only offer embargoes to journalists you've worked with** or have strong reputations for honoring them
- State the embargo time clearly: day, time, timezone
- If they break embargo, your relationship with them is over

### Exclusives

"Only you get this story" — powerful tool, use sparingly.

- **First-tier outlet only** — exclusives to tier 2/3 outlets waste the lever
- **Be honest about scope** — "exclusive to [outlet] in the US" is fine
- **Have a parallel plan** — what you publish/pitch the next day after the exclusive runs

### Follow-up cadence

- **Day 0** — initial pitch
- **Day 3** — one follow-up if you have new information ("Just talked to [customer] who can join us")
- **Day 7** — final check-in with a fresh hook ("This came out today, still relevant?")
- **After day 7** — let it go. Re-pitch when you have something genuinely new.

**Never:**
- "Bumping this up" / "Did you see my email?"
- Multi-day silent follow-ups with no new value
- Same pitch reformatted

---

## Pitch Killers

Things that instantly disqualify your pitch:

- Wrong name / wrong outlet (autoreplace fail)
- Pitching topics they explicitly don't cover
- Press release attached as PDF (just paste the key bits)
- Long signature with logos and disclaimers
- CC'ing 5 other journalists on the same email
- "Per my last email" energy
- Asking them to sign an NDA before talking
- Pitching a story you can't actually tell (no customer willing to talk, no data ready to share)

---

## Tooling

### Finding journalist contact info

```bash
# Most journalists' emails follow patterns:
# firstname@outlet.com
# firstname.lastname@outlet.com
# flastname@outlet.com
# Use Hunter.io, RocketReach, or just guess and bounce-check
```

### Researching their recent work (browser-driven)

Use `dev-browser` (persistent session, no rate limits) to:
- Open the journalist's outlet author page → scrape last 5 article headlines + dates
- Open their X/Twitter profile → note recent topics
- Open their LinkedIn → confirm current role

Output what you find as:

```
JOURNALIST PROFILE — [name]
Outlet: [name]
Beat: [topics from last 5 articles]
Recent angle: [pattern you noticed]
Recent X activity: [what they're posting]
Score: [X/40 from rubric]
Best pitch angle: [from template library]
Email: [confirmed]
```

### Maintaining the media list

Store in `.agents/media-list.md` (or `.csv` if you prefer). Update monthly — journalists move jobs constantly.

```markdown
## Tier 1 (top 20)
| Name | Outlet | Beat | Last contact | Last coverage | Email | Score |
|------|--------|------|--------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| ...  | ...    | ...  | 2026-05-15   | none yet      | ...   | 9/10  |
```

### Pitch tracking

Track in a simple spreadsheet:
- Date sent
- Subject line
- Journalist
- Outlet
- Response (open / reply / pass / coverage)
- What they said

After 30 pitches, you'll see which subject patterns and which angles work for you specifically.

# Media Outlets — Where to Pitch

A curated, opinionated list of *where* to pitch for software/SaaS PR. This is the media-outlet slice of resources like submit.co — the journalist-driven half. For startup/SaaS/AI directories (Product Hunt, BetaList, Futurepedia, etc.), use the separate `directory-submissions` skill — different intent, different audience.

## How to use this list

- **Don't pitch a publication. Pitch a journalist at that publication.** See [journalist-pitching.md](journalist-pitching.md) for the discovery workflow.
- **Tier signals quality, not effort** — a small tier-3 outlet might be perfect for your niche
- **Submission/tip URLs are listed where they exist** — but a journalist's email beats a tip form every time
- **This list ages fast** — verify the outlet still exists and the journalist is still there before pitching

---

## Tech & Startup Press (Tier 1)

The big names. High bar to clear, high payoff when you do. Pitch the specific reporter, not the tip line.

| Outlet | Best for | Tip URL |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **TechCrunch** | Funding, product launches, startup news | techcrunch.com/got-a-tip/ |
| **The Verge** | Consumer tech, product reviews, policy | theverge.com/contact |
| **Wired** | Long-form tech, culture, business | wired.com/about/feedback |
| **Fast Company** | Innovation, design, business strategy | fastcompany.com/contact-us |
| **VentureBeat** | AI, enterprise tech, gaming | venturebeat.com/contribute |
| **Ars Technica** | Deep tech, science, policy | arstechnica.com/contact-us |
| **The Information** | Subscription-gated, scoops on tech industry | theinformation.com/about |
| **Bloomberg / Reuters** | Business, finance, big-picture stories | bloomberg.com/feedback |
| **WSJ Tech** | Enterprise, business angle | wsj.com/tips |
| **NYT Tech** | Mainstream tech, culture | nytimes.com/tips |

---

## SaaS & B2B (Tier 1–2)

Lower-profile than the consumer tech outlets but often higher ROI for B2B SaaS.

| Outlet | Best for | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **SaaStr** | B2B SaaS founders, growth, sales | Jason Lemkin's outlet; pitch contributed posts |
| **First Round Review** | Operator-level B2B insights | High bar; original frameworks only |
| **OpenView** | SaaS metrics, PLG, pricing | Often runs research-backed pieces |
| **Lenny's Newsletter** | Product / growth | Subscriber-only; pitch via Lenny directly on X |
| **Future (a16z)** | Tech + culture pieces | Long-form, original thinking required |
| **Stratechery** | Tech strategy analysis | Don't pitch Ben Thompson; engage via responses |

---

## AI / ML Press (Tier 1–2)

The hottest beat right now. Reporters here are inundated — your angle has to be sharp.

| Outlet | Best for | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **The Decoder** | AI news, fast-turn | Daily AI news cycle |
| **Import AI** (Jack Clark) | Weekly AI newsletter | Pitch research-backed angles |
| **The Batch** (Andrew Ng) | AI industry analysis | Submitted by deeplearning.ai team |
| **MIT Technology Review** | AI policy, capability, ethics | Higher bar, slower cycle |
| **Hugging Face blog** | Open-source AI tools | Contributed posts welcome |
| **Latent Space** | Practitioner-focused AI/ML | Podcast + newsletter |

---

## Developer & DevTools Press

Where to pitch if your audience is engineers.

| Outlet | Best for | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **The New Stack** | DevTools, infra, cloud-native | Active contributor program |
| **InfoQ** | Enterprise dev, software architecture | Long-form technical pieces |
| **DEV.to** | Self-published, community-driven | Build credibility before pitching |
| **Hacker Noon** | Tech blogging platform | Easy to publish but low signal |
| **Console** | DevTools newsletter | Curated weekly; submit projects |
| **DevTools FM** | Podcast | Pitch as guest |

---

## Business & Marketing Press

For pitching the business / marketing angle of your story.

| Outlet | Best for | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Inc.** | Founder stories, business advice | Contributor program available |
| **Entrepreneur** | Small business, growth | Volume publisher; quality varies |
| **HBR.org** | Original research, frameworks | High bar; long lead time |
| **MarketingProfs** | B2B marketing | Contributor-friendly |
| **Marketing Brew (Morning Brew)** | Daily marketing newsletter | Reporter-driven, pitch directly |
| **Marketing Land / Search Engine Journal** | SEO, SEM, channels | Niche but high-intent audience |
| **Reforge** | Growth, product, retention | Original framework required |

---

## Newsletters (Reporter-Driven)

Newsletters are increasingly the most valuable PR placement — small audiences, but high-intent.

| Newsletter | Audience | How to pitch |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Lenny's Newsletter** | Product/growth, ~600k readers | DM Lenny on X with sharp angle |
| **The Pragmatic Engineer** (Gergely Orosz) | Software eng leaders | Pitch via email; original engineering insights |

| **Platformer** (Casey Newton) | Tech + policy | Pitch via Substack |
| **Big Technology** (Alex Kantrowitz) | Big Tech analysis | Pitch via Substack |
| **Not Boring** (Packy McCormick) | Tech + culture | Tough to crack; original takes only |

**For B2B SaaS:**
- **SaaStr Daily**
- **Demand Curve**
- **Growth Unhinged** (Kyle Poyar)
- **Trends.vc**

**For AI:**
- **Import AI** (Jack Clark)
- **The Batch** (Andrew Ng)
- **The Algorithm** (MIT Tech Review)
- **Interconnects** (Nathan Lambert)
- **AI Tidbits**

---

## Podcasts

A podcast appearance is often higher leverage than a press hit — longer engagement, evergreen replay, audience trust transfer.

### Top SaaS / startup podcasts
- **Lenny's Podcast** — product/growth
- **My First Million** — founder stories, business ideas
- **The Twenty Minute VC** — funding angle
- **SaaStr Podcast** — B2B SaaS
- **Acquired** — deep-dive company stories (don't pitch unless you're a unicorn)
- **The All-In Podcast** — broad tech/business (very hard to get on)

### Top AI podcasts
- **No Priors** (Sarah Guo, Elad Gil)
- **Latent Space**
- **Practical AI**
- **The TWIML AI Podcast**
- **The Cognitive Revolution**

### Top dev / engineering podcasts
- **The Changelog**
- **Software Engineering Daily**
- **DevTools FM**

### How to pitch a podcast

1. **Listen to 3 episodes** — non-negotiable
2. **Find the host's preferred channel** (X DM, email, guest form)
3. **Pitch a topic, not yourself** — "I'd love to come on and talk about [specific angle]" not "I'd love to be a guest"
4. **Bring evidence** — links to other appearances, your unique angle, what listeners will learn
5. **Make it easy** — bio, headshot, suggested questions in the pitch

---

## Industry / Vertical Press

Don't overlook trade press — smaller audience, much higher intent.

| Vertical | Outlets to investigate |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Marketing** | Adweek, Marketing Brew, AdAge, Search Engine Land |
| **Sales** | Sales Hacker, Modern Sales Pros |
| **HR / People Ops** | HR Brew, SHRM, HR Dive |
| **Finance / Fintech** | The Block, CoinDesk, Finextra |
| **Healthcare tech** | STAT, MobiHealthNews, Healthcare IT News |
| **Education tech** | EdSurge, EdScoop |
| **Real estate tech** | Inman, The Real Deal |
| **Legal tech** | Above the Law, Law360 |
| **Climate tech** | Heatmap, Canary Media, Latitude Media |
| **Devtools** | The New Stack, InfoQ, DevOps.com |

For your specific vertical: Google `"top publications" + "[your industry]"` and run the same scoring exercise from [journalist-pitching.md](journalist-pitching.md).

---

## Regional / Local

If your company has a regional angle (HQ location, customer concentration, government contract), local press is underrated.

- **Local business journals** — Bizjournals network covers 40+ US cities
- **Local NPR affiliates** — high-quality, business angle welcomed
- **Local TV business segments** — high reach, easy to get
- **State / regional tech news** — e.g., Built In (Chicago, Austin, etc.), TechBuzz (Utah)

---

## What's NOT On This List (And Why)

- **Product Hunt, BetaList, Indie Hackers** — these are directories, not press. Use the `directory-submissions` skill.
- **Press release wires** (PRNewswire, BusinessWire, GlobeNewswire) — overpriced for early-stage; journalists ignore them. Skip until you have IR / SEC requirements.
- **"As featured in" badge mills** — paid "media coverage" services. Worthless and damaging.
- **Random "guest post" SEO link networks** — Google penalizes these. Don't.

---

## Maintaining This List

This list will go stale. Recommended cadence:

- **Quarterly:** verify your tier-1 contacts are still at the outlet
- **Monthly:** add new outlets/newsletters relevant to your category
- **Per pitch:** confirm the journalist is still there before sending (check X / LinkedIn for "joined [new place]")

Store your live, working version in `.agents/media-list.md` (per [journalist-pitching.md](journalist-pitching.md)).

# Newsjacking — Reactive PR Workflow

Injecting your POV into a story that's already trending. Done well: free distribution off a wave of attention. Done badly: cringe at best, brand damage at worst.

## Contents
- When newsjacking works (and when it doesn't)
- The detect → score → angle → pitch loop
- Newsworthiness scoring rubric
- Story angle library
- Speed: the only thing that matters
- Sources & tooling
- Failure modes

---

## When Newsjacking Works

- **Tech/regulatory news in your category** — new law, new platform launch, competitor pivot, big acquisition
- **Industry data drops** — a major report drops, you have a sharper take or contradicting data
- **Public conversation** — a debate or controversy where your expertise is genuinely relevant
- **Seasonal/cyclical moments** — earnings season, year-end reviews, conference weeks

## When to Skip

- **Tragedies, accidents, deaths** — no exceptions. Don't.
- **Politically charged stories** unless your brand explicitly takes political stances
- **You have no genuine expertise** in the area
- **The window is already closed** — if a story is 48h+ old and you weren't first, you're late
- **The angle is "we have a product for this"** — that's marketing, not journalism

---

## The Loop

A repeatable workflow Claude can run on demand or daily.

1. **Detect** — surface trending stories in your category (see [Sources & Tooling](#sources--tooling))
2. **Score** — apply the [newsworthiness rubric](#newsworthiness-scoring-rubric); drop anything below threshold
3. **Angle** — generate 2–3 angles per story using the [angle library](#story-angle-library)
4. **Validate** — sanity-check: do you actually have the expertise/data to back this angle?
5. **Pitch** — draft a tight pitch to 3–5 journalists who cover this beat (see [journalist-pitching.md](journalist-pitching.md))
6. **Post** — also publish on your blog, LinkedIn, X — it builds the trail journalists check before quoting you

Output format Claude should produce:

```
NEWSJACK CANDIDATE — 2026-06-10

Story: "EU passes AI Act amendment requiring agent registration"
Source: TechCrunch, 3h ago
Score: 8/10 (high relevance, fresh, you have proprietary data)

Angles:
1. Data hot take: "Our analysis of 12,000 agent deployments shows 73% would fail this requirement"
2. Contrarian: "Why the registration rule will hurt safety, not improve it"
3. Customer story: "How [customer] is preparing — interview offer"

Recommended: #1 (you have unique data, strongest hook)
Pitch draft: [see journalist-pitching.md for template]
Target journalists: [list with rationale]
```

## Newsworthiness Scoring Rubric

Score each candidate 1–10 on five dimensions, multiply by the weight, then sum. Max possible: 80 (10 × the 8x weight total).

| Dimension | What it measures | Weight |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Timeliness** | Story <24h old? Window still open? | 2x |
| **Relevance** | Genuinely in your expertise area? | 2x |
| **Angle uniqueness** | Can you say something no one else is saying? | 2x |
| **Authority** | Do you have data, customers, or experience to back it? | 1x |
| **Reach potential** | Will this story keep growing or has it peaked? | 1x |

**Threshold:** weighted total ≥ 50/80. Below that, skip.

**Auto-disqualify if:**
- The story is about something tragic
- Your angle is "I disagree" with nothing to back it
- You haven't actually formed an opinion — you just want to be quoted

## Story Angle Library

Use these templates to generate angles fast.

### 1. Data hot take
*"We analyzed [N] [things] after [event]. Here's what we found."*

Best when you have proprietary data. The journalist gets a stat, you get the citation.

### 2. Contrarian
*"Everyone says [popular take]. Here's why they're wrong."*

Best when you can defend the position with specifics. Weak when it's just contrarianism for attention.

### 3. "We predicted this"
*"Six months ago we wrote [thing] — here's what's happening now and what's next."*

Best when you actually did predict it. Lethal to your credibility if you didn't.

### 4. Customer impact
*"Here's a [customer type] who's directly affected. We can put you in touch."*

Best for B2B. Reporters love named customers willing to talk.

### 5. Insider explainer
*"This story is complicated. Here's what's actually happening."*

Best when most coverage is missing nuance. You're not arguing — you're educating.

### 6. Trend connector
*"This isn't isolated — it's part of a bigger shift we're seeing in [pattern]."*

Best when you have several data points or examples to connect.

### 7. Founder POV
*"As someone who's built in this space for [X years], here's the part most people are missing."*

Best for opinion pieces / op-eds. Weak as a soundbite pitch.

## Speed: The Only Thing That Matters

Newsjacking decays fast. Approximate windows:

| Story type | Effective window |
|-----------|------------------|
| Breaking tech news | 4–12 hours |
| Major regulation / policy | 24–48 hours |
| Industry report / data drop | 24–72 hours |
| Conference announcement | Same day |
| Acquisition / funding news | 12–24 hours |

**Implication:** if you can't draft and send within the window, don't bother. Set up the loop so detection → pitch takes <2 hours.

---

## Sources & Tooling

Reuses tooling from the `social` skill's listening workflow. Same install: `brew install jq`.

### Google News RSS (no auth)

```bash
# Replace QUERY with topic (use + for spaces, %22 for quotes)
curl -s "https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=QUERY&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en" \
  | xmllint --xpath "//item[position()<11]" - 2>/dev/null
```

### Hacker News (Algolia) for tech stories

```bash
SINCE=$(($(date +%s) - 86400))
curl -s "https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?query=QUERY&tags=story&numericFilters=created_at_i>${SINCE}" \
  | jq '.hits[] | {title, url, points, num_comments, created_at, hn_url: ("https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id="+.objectID)}'
```

### Reddit (for category-specific subs)

```bash
curl -s -A "newsjack/1.0" \
  "https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/top.json?t=day&limit=15" \
  | jq '.data.children[].data | {title, url, score, num_comments, created_utc}'
```

### Journalist research (browser-driven)

For finding *which* journalists are covering the story right now:
- **dev-browser** → Google News search for the story → click through to articles → note the bylines
- Then go to those journalists' X / LinkedIn / Muck Rack profile to confirm beat and recent coverage

See also [journalist-pitching.md](journalist-pitching.md) for the full discovery workflow.

### Source list

For repeatable monitoring, add a "Newsjacking topics" section to `.agents/listening-sources.md` (template in the `social` skill's references):

```markdown
## Newsjacking topics (Google News RSS)
- "AI agent regulation"
- "[your category] funding"
- "[your competitors] OR [adjacent competitors]"

## Industry data drops (RSS / manual)
- Pitchbook reports
- a16z state of [industry] reports
- [your category] benchmark reports
```

## Failure Modes

Things that have ended careers and brands.

- **Tragedy-jacking** — Oreo's 2013 Super Bowl tweet worked. Most attempts since have not. Wartime, disasters, deaths: don't.
- **The forced fit** — "Here's our take on [trending story] — it's actually about [our product]." Journalists see through this instantly.
- **The empty take** — pitching "we have an opinion" without specifics. Journalists need a quote-worthy line, not "we're closely watching this."
- **Speed without judgment** — being first with a bad take is worse than being late with a good one. The 30-minute "is this brand-appropriate?" gut check exists for a reason.
- **Pitching the same angle to 50 journalists** — they talk. Get caught once, lose the relationships.
- **No follow-through** — pitch goes out, journalist responds in 20 minutes, founder takes 6 hours to reply. Story moves on.

---

## Companion Practice: The Public Trail

Every newsjack pitch is stronger if the journalist can find evidence you've been thinking about this publicly. Before pitching:

1. Publish a short post (blog, LinkedIn, X thread) with your take
2. Reference it in the pitch ("more thinking here: [link]")
3. This signals you're not opportunistic — you're an actual voice in the space

If you don't have time to publish, you're probably not ready to pitch.

# Press Request Platforms — Inbound PR

Journalists posting "I need a source for X" — you respond, sometimes you get quoted, sometimes you don't. The cheapest PR play available, but only if you treat it seriously.

- Daily triage workflow
- Response template
- What makes a response get selected
- What kills a response

## The Major Platforms

| Platform | What it is | Cost | Quality |
|----------|-----------|------|---------|
| **[Connectively](https://www.connectively.us)** (formerly HARO) | Daily email digest of journalist queries | Free tier; paid for filters | Mixed — high volume, lots of noise |
| **[Qwoted](https://www.qwoted.com)** | Web app with journalist requests | Free; paid for outreach | Good — better-quality outlets |
| **[Featured](https://featured.com)** | Web app, expert profiles, journalist requests | Free tier; paid pro | Good for thought-leadership snippets |
| **[Help A B2B Writer](https://helpab2bwriter.com)** | Twice-weekly email of B2B queries | Free | High — B2B-focused, low spam |
| **[SourceBottle](https://www.sourcebottle.com)** | Australia-focused but global queries | Free | Variable |
| **[Terkel](https://terkel.io)** | Roundup-style ("we asked 50 experts…") | Free | Volume-heavy, low effort |
| **[JournoRequests](https://twitter.com/journorequests)** | X account aggregating tweets | Free | UK-skewed, real-time |
| **#JournoRequest** (X hashtag) | Live journalist requests | Free | Real-time, fast-moving |

**Recommended starter set:** Connectively + Qwoted + Help A B2B Writer + monitoring `#JournoRequest` on X.

## Daily Triage Workflow

These platforms generate volume. Treat it like email triage — fast pass, deep response on the rare matches.

### Step 1 — Filter (5 min)

For each digest / request feed:
- Drop everything where you don't have **direct experience or data**
- Drop everything from outlets your ICP doesn't read
- Drop everything with a deadline you can't meet
- Keep only requests where you can give a **complete, named, on-the-record answer**

Realistic conversion: 50 daily requests → 2–4 worth answering.

### Step 2 — Deep response (15 min per request)

For each keeper:
- Read the request 3 times — what's the *actual* angle?
- Look up the journalist if possible — recent coverage, beat
- Write a custom response (see [template](#response-template))
- Send within their stated deadline (early > late)

### Step 3 — Log

Track in a spreadsheet:
- Date
- Platform
- Journalist + outlet
- Topic
- Response sent (yes/no)
- Outcome (no response / passed / quoted / linked)

After 30 responses, you'll see which topics/platforms convert.

---

## Response Template

Keep responses under 200 words. Journalists are scanning 50+ replies for one quote.

```
Hi [name],

Quick response to your request about [topic].

[Specific credential — 1 sentence. "Built X for 5 years" / "Led marketing at Y" / "Have analyzed N companies in space"]

The most important thing about [topic]: [your actual point in 2 sentences].

[A specific example, story, or data point — this is what gets quoted.]

[If applicable: a contrarian or surprising angle that differentiates from typical answers.]

Happy to expand on any of this, share data, or be quoted directly.

Feel free to use this attribution:
[Your name], [your title], [your company]

Contact for follow-up: [email + phone]
```

**Note the structure:**
1. One-sentence intro
2. One-sentence credential
3. Two-sentence answer
4. Specific example (the quotable part)
5. Optional: differentiator
6. Clear offer
7. Pre-written attribution (saves them 30 seconds)
8. Contact info

## What Makes a Response Get Selected

After analyzing hundreds of quoted responses, the patterns:

### Quotable specificity
**Bad:** "Companies should focus on customer experience."
**Good:** "When we A/B tested 47 onboarding flows, the version with a 30-second video at step 3 increased activation by 41%."

The good version is a quote. The bad version is filler.

### Concrete credential
**Bad:** "As a marketing expert..."
**Good:** "I've run growth at three Series B SaaS companies, all in B2B sales tooling."

Specificity beats title-stacking.

### Story over advice
**Bad:** "It's important to track the right metrics."
**Good:** "We almost shut down because we were optimizing for MRR when our real problem was activation. Once we switched to tracking 7-day activation, everything else followed."

Stories make articles. Advice makes filler.

### Pre-formatted for their workflow
- Pre-written attribution
- Multiple quotable lines (let them pick)
- High-res headshot link (don't attach)
- One-line company description

### Time match
**Most quotes come from responses sent in the first 6 hours.** After 24 hours, your chances drop sharply. Treat deadlines as if they're 24h earlier than stated.

---

## What Kills a Response

- **Pitching your product** when they asked for expert commentary
- **Generic advice** that could come from any expert
- **Multiple "experts" from your company** responding to the same request (looks coordinated, often is)
- **Hiring a PR firm to spam responses** — journalists smell it
- **Demanding a link back** to your site — most can't promise links
- **Ignoring the deadline** by 1+ days
- **Long bio sections** before the actual answer
- **Asking to "see the article before publication"** — you don't get to do that
- **Asking what other experts said** so you can differentiate — they won't tell you

---

## ROI Reality Check

Most teams overinvest in these platforms because they're cheap. Be honest:

| Effort | Realistic outcome (90 days) |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 5 hr/week, custom responses | 3–10 quoted placements |
| 1 hr/week, template responses | 0–2 placements |
| Outsourced to PR firm | Lots of submissions, few quotes |

**A quote in a tier-1 outlet is worth:**
- A backlink (DR depends on outlet)
- A sales-collateral asset ("As featured in...")
- AI-citation surface area
- Brand legitimacy in the abstract

**A quote in a tier-3 outlet is worth:**
- A backlink, often nofollow
- Maybe an Instagram screenshot

**Decision rule:** if you can sustain 5 hr/week of quality responses for 90 days, this is worth it. If you can only do 1 hr/week, skip it and invest in [proactive pitching](journalist-pitching.md) instead.

## Setup Checklist

Before you start responding:

- [ ] Press page exists and is current (see main SKILL.md)
- [ ] One-line credential is written and rehearsed
- [ ] Headshot is high-res and at a public URL
- [ ] You have 3–5 specific stories / data points ready to deploy
- [ ] You've decided which 2–3 platforms to use (don't try all 7)
- [ ] You've blocked a daily 20-min window for triage
- [ ] You're logging responses in a tracker

Without these, you're spamming and wasting their time and yours.
