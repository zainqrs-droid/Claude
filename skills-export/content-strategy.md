# Content Strategy

You are a content strategist. Your goal is to help plan content that drives traffic, builds authority, and generates leads by being either searchable, shareable, or both.

## Before Planning

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Business Context
- What does the company do?
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What's the primary goal for content? (traffic, leads, brand awareness, thought leadership)
- What problems does your product solve?

### 2. Customer Research
- What questions do customers ask before buying?
- What objections come up in sales calls?
- What topics appear repeatedly in support tickets?
- What language do customers use to describe their problems?

### 3. Current State
- Do you have existing content? What's working?
- What resources do you have? (writers, budget, time)
- What content formats can you produce? (written, video, audio)

### 4. Competitive Landscape
- Who are your main competitors?
- What content gaps exist in your market?

---

## Searchable vs Shareable

Every piece of content must be searchable, shareable, or both. Prioritize in that order—search traffic is the foundation.

**Searchable content** captures existing demand. Optimized for people actively looking for answers.

**Shareable content** creates demand. Spreads ideas and gets people talking.

### When Writing Searchable Content

- Target a specific keyword or question
- Match search intent exactly—answer what the searcher wants
- Use clear titles that match search queries
- Structure with headings that mirror search patterns
- Place keywords in title, headings, first paragraph, URL
- Provide comprehensive coverage (don't leave questions unanswered)
- Include data, examples, and links to authoritative sources
- Optimize for AI/LLM discovery: clear positioning, structured content, brand consistency across the web

### When Writing Shareable Content

- Lead with a novel insight, original data, or counterintuitive take
- Challenge conventional wisdom with well-reasoned arguments
- Tell stories that make people feel something
- Create content people want to share to look smart or help others
- Connect to current trends or emerging problems
- Share vulnerable, honest experiences others can learn from

---

## Content Types

### Searchable Content Types

**Use-Case Content**
Formula: [persona] + [use-case]. Targets long-tail keywords.
- "Project management for designers"
- "Task tracking for developers"
- "Client collaboration for freelancers"

**Hub and Spoke**
Hub = comprehensive overview. Spokes = related subtopics.
```
/topic (hub)
├── /topic/subtopic-1 (spoke)
├── /topic/subtopic-2 (spoke)
└── /topic/subtopic-3 (spoke)
```
Create hub first, then build spokes. Interlink strategically.

**Note:** Most content works fine under `/blog`. Only use dedicated hub/spoke URL structures for major topics with layered depth (e.g., Atlassian's `/agile` guide). For typical blog posts, `/blog/post-title` is sufficient.

**Template Libraries**
High-intent keywords + product adoption.
- Target searches like "marketing plan template"
- Provide immediate standalone value
- Show how product enhances the template

### Shareable Content Types

**Thought Leadership**
- Articulate concepts everyone feels but hasn't named
- Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence
- Share vulnerable, honest experiences

**Data-Driven Content**
- Product data analysis (anonymized insights)
- Public data analysis (uncover patterns)
- Original research (run experiments, share results)

**Expert Roundups**
15-30 experts answering one specific question. Built-in distribution.

**Case Studies**
Structure: Challenge → Solution → Results → Key learnings

**Meta Content**
Behind-the-scenes transparency. "How We Got Our First $5k MRR," "Why We Chose Debt Over VC."

For programmatic content at scale, see **programmatic-seo** skill.

## Content Pillars and Topic Clusters

Content pillars are the 3-5 core topics your brand will own. Each pillar spawns a cluster of related content.

Most of the time, all content can live under `/blog` with good internal linking between related posts. Dedicated pillar pages with custom URL structures (like `/guides/topic`) are only needed when you're building comprehensive resources with multiple layers of depth.

### How to Identify Pillars

1. **Product-led**: What problems does your product solve?
2. **Audience-led**: What does your ICP need to learn?
3. **Search-led**: What topics have volume in your space?
4. **Competitor-led**: What are competitors ranking for?

### Pillar Structure

```
Pillar Topic (Hub)
├── Subtopic Cluster 1
│   ├── Article A
│   ├── Article B
│   └── Article C
├── Subtopic Cluster 2
│   ├── Article D
│   ├── Article E
│   └── Article F
└── Subtopic Cluster 3
    ├── Article G
    ├── Article H
    └── Article I
```

### Pillar Criteria

Good pillars should:
- Align with your product/service
- Match what your audience cares about
- Have search volume and/or social interest
- Be broad enough for many subtopics

---

## Keyword Research by Buyer Stage

Map topics to the buyer's journey using proven keyword modifiers:

### Awareness Stage
Modifiers: "what is," "how to," "guide to," "introduction to"

Example: If customers ask about project management basics:
- "What is Agile Project Management"
- "Guide to Sprint Planning"
- "How to Run a Standup Meeting"

### Consideration Stage
Modifiers: "best," "top," "vs," "alternatives," "comparison"

Example: If customers evaluate multiple tools:
- "Best Project Management Tools for Remote Teams"
- "Asana vs Trello vs Monday"
- "Basecamp Alternatives"

### Decision Stage
Modifiers: "pricing," "reviews," "demo," "trial," "buy"

Example: If pricing comes up in sales calls:
- "Project Management Tool Pricing Comparison"
- "How to Choose the Right Plan"
- "[Product] Reviews"

### Implementation Stage
Modifiers: "templates," "examples," "tutorial," "how to use," "setup"

Example: If support tickets show implementation struggles:
- "Project Template Library"
- "Step-by-Step Setup Tutorial"
- "How to Use [Feature]"

---

## Content Ideation Sources

### 1. Keyword Data

If user provides keyword exports (Ahrefs, SEMrush, GSC), analyze for:
- Topic clusters (group related keywords)
- Buyer stage (awareness/consideration/decision/implementation)
- Search intent (informational, commercial, transactional)
- Quick wins (low competition + decent volume + high relevance)
- Content gaps (keywords competitors rank for that you don't)

Output as prioritized table:
| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Buyer Stage | Content Type | Priority |

### 2. Call Transcripts

If user provides sales or customer call transcripts, extract:
- Questions asked → FAQ content or blog posts
- Pain points → problems in their own words
- Objections → content to address proactively
- Language patterns → exact phrases to use (voice of customer)
- Competitor mentions → what they compared you to

Output content ideas with supporting quotes.

### 3. Survey Responses

If user provides survey data, mine for:
- Open-ended responses (topics and language)
- Common themes (30%+ mention = high priority)
- Resource requests (what they wish existed)
- Content preferences (formats they want)

### 4. Forum Research

Use web search to find content ideas:

**Reddit:** `site:reddit.com [topic]`
- Top posts in relevant subreddits
- Questions and frustrations in comments
- Upvoted answers (validates what resonates)

**Quora:** `site:quora.com [topic]`
- Most-followed questions
- Highly upvoted answers

**Other:** Indie Hackers, Hacker News, Product Hunt, industry Slack/Discord

Extract: FAQs, misconceptions, debates, problems being solved, terminology used.

### 5. Competitor Analysis

Use web search to analyze competitor content:

**Find their content:** `site:competitor.com/blog`

**Analyze:**
- Top-performing posts (comments, shares)
- Topics covered repeatedly
- Gaps they haven't covered
- Case studies (customer problems, use cases, results)
- Content structure (pillars, categories, formats)

**Identify opportunities:**
- Topics you can cover better
- Angles they're missing
- Outdated content to improve on

### 6. Sales and Support Input

Extract from customer-facing teams:
- Common objections
- Repeated questions
- Support ticket patterns
- Success stories
- Feature requests and underlying problems

# Headless CMS Guide

Reference for choosing, modeling, and implementing a headless CMS for marketing content.

## When to Use This Reference

Use this when selecting a CMS for a new project, designing content models for marketing sites, setting up editorial workflows, or connecting CMS content to programmatic pages.

---

## Headless vs Traditional CMS

A headless CMS separates content management from presentation. Content is stored in a structured backend and delivered via API to any frontend.

### When Headless Makes Sense

- Multiple frontends consume the same content (web, mobile, email)
- Developers want full control over the frontend stack
- Content needs to be reused across channels
- You're building with a modern framework (Next.js, Remix, Astro)
- Marketing needs structured, reusable content blocks

### When Traditional Works Better

- Small team with no dedicated developers
- Simple blog or brochure site
- WYSIWYG editing is a hard requirement
- Budget is tight and WordPress/Webflow does the job

### Decision Checklist

| Factor | Headless | Traditional |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-channel delivery | Yes | Limited |
| Developer control | Full | Constrained |
| Non-technical editing | Requires setup | Built-in |
| Time to launch | Longer | Faster |
| Content reuse | Native | Manual |
| Hosting flexibility | Any frontend | Platform-dependent |

---

## Content Modeling for Marketing

### Core Principles

1. **Think in types, not pages.** A "Landing Page" is a content type with fields — not an HTML file. This lets you reuse components across pages.
2. **Separate content from presentation.** Store the headline text, not the styled headline. Presentation belongs in the frontend.
3. **Design for reuse.** If testimonials appear on 5 pages, create a Testimonial type and reference it — don't duplicate.
4. **Keep models flat.** Deeply nested structures are hard to query and maintain. Prefer references over nesting.

### Common Marketing Content Types

| Type | Key Fields | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Landing Page** | title, slug, hero, sections[], seo | Modular sections for flexibility |
| **Blog Post** | title, slug, body, author, category, tags, publishedAt, seo | Rich text or Portable Text body |
| **Case Study** | title, customer, challenge, solution, results, metrics[], logo | Link to related products/features |
| **Testimonial** | quote, author, role, company, avatar, rating | Reference from landing pages |
| **FAQ** | question, answer, category | Group by category for programmatic pages |
| **Author** | name, bio, avatar, social links | Reference from blog posts |
| **CTA Block** | heading, body, buttonText, buttonUrl, variant | Reusable across pages |

### SEO Fields Checklist

Every page-level content type needs:

- `metaTitle` — 50-60 characters
- `metaDescription` — 150-160 characters
- `ogImage` — 1200x630px social preview
- `slug` — URL path segment
- `canonicalUrl` — optional override
- `noIndex` — boolean for excluding from search
- `structuredData` — optional JSON-LD override

---

## Editorial Workflows

### Draft → Review → Publish Cycle

1. **Draft** — Author creates or edits content
2. **Review** — Editor reviews for accuracy, brand voice, SEO
3. **Approve** — Stakeholder signs off
4. **Schedule** — Set publish date/time
5. **Publish** — Content goes live via API

### Preview APIs

All major headless CMS platforms support draft previews:

- **Sanity**: Real-time preview with `useLiveQuery` or Presentation tool
- **Contentful**: Preview API (`preview.contentful.com`) with separate access token
- **Strapi**: Draft & Publish system with `status=draft` query parameter (v5; replaces v4's `publicationState`)

Set up a preview route in your frontend (e.g., `/api/preview`) that authenticates and renders draft content.

### Roles and Permissions

| Role | Can Create | Can Edit | Can Publish | Can Delete |
|------|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| Author | Yes | Own | No | Own drafts |
| Editor | Yes | All | Yes | Drafts |
| Admin | Yes | All | Yes | All |

Exact permission models vary by platform. Sanity uses role-based access. Contentful has space-level roles. Strapi has granular RBAC.

---

## Platform Comparison

| Feature | Sanity | Contentful | Strapi |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| Hosting | Cloud (managed) | Cloud (managed) | Self-hosted or Cloud |
| Query Language | GROQ | REST / GraphQL | REST / GraphQL |
| Free Tier | Generous | Limited | Open source (free) |
| Real-time Collab | Yes (built-in) | Limited | No |
| Best For | Developer flexibility | Enterprise multi-locale | Budget / self-hosted |
| Content Modeling | Schema-as-code | Web UI | Web UI or code |
| Media Handling | Built-in DAM | Built-in | Plugin-based |

### Sanity

**Strengths**: GROQ query language is powerful and flexible. Schema defined in code (version-controlled). Real-time collaborative editing. Portable Text for rich content. Generous free tier.

**Considerations**: Steeper learning curve for non-developers. Studio customization requires React knowledge. Vendor lock-in on GROQ queries.

**Marketing fit**: Best when developers and marketers collaborate closely. Strong for content-heavy sites with complex models.

### Contentful

**Strengths**: Mature enterprise platform. Excellent multi-locale support. Strong ecosystem of integrations. Composable content with Studio. Well-documented APIs.

**Considerations**: Pricing scales with content types and locales. Two separate APIs (Delivery and Management). Rate limits can be tight on lower plans.

**Marketing fit**: Best for enterprises with multi-market content needs. Good when you need established vendor reliability.

### Strapi

**Strengths**: Open source, self-hosted option. Full control over data. No per-seat pricing. Customizable admin panel. Plugin ecosystem. REST by default, GraphQL via plugin.

**Considerations**: Self-hosting means you handle infrastructure. Smaller ecosystem than Sanity/Contentful. V5 migration can be significant from V4.

**Marketing fit**: Best for teams with DevOps capability who want full control and no vendor lock-in. Good for budget-conscious projects.

### Others Worth Knowing

- **Hygraph** — GraphQL-native, strong for federation and multi-source content
- **Keystatic** — Git-based, good for developer-content hybrid workflows
- **Payload** — TypeScript-first, self-hosted, code-configured like Sanity
- **Builder.io** — Visual editor with headless backend, good for non-technical marketers
- **Prismic** — Slice-based content modeling, strong Next.js integration

## Integration with Marketing Skills

### Programmatic SEO

Use CMS as the data source for programmatic pages. Store structured data (FAQs, comparisons, city pages) as content types and generate pages from queries. See **programmatic-seo** skill.

### Copywriting

CMS content models enforce consistent structure. Define fields that match your copy frameworks (headline, subheadline, social proof, CTA). See **copywriting** skill.

### Site Architecture

URL structure, navigation hierarchy, and internal linking all depend on how content is organized in the CMS. Plan your content model and site architecture together. See **site-architecture** skill.

### Email Sequences

Pull CMS content into email templates for consistent messaging across web and email. Case studies, testimonials, and blog posts can feed email nurture sequences. See **emails** skill.
