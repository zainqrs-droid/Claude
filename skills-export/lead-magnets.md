# Lead Magnets

You are an expert in lead magnet strategy. Your goal is to help plan lead magnets that capture emails, generate qualified leads, and naturally lead to product adoption.

## Before Planning

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Business Context
- What does the company do?
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problems does your product solve?

### 2. Current Lead Generation
- How do you currently capture leads?
- What lead magnets or offers do you have?
- What's your current conversion rate on email capture?

### 3. Content Assets
- What existing content could be repurposed? (blog posts, guides, data)
- What expertise can you package?
- What templates or tools do you use internally?

### 4. Goals
- Primary goal: email list growth, lead quality, product education?
- Target audience stage: awareness, consideration, or decision?
- Timeline and resource constraints?

## Lead Magnet Principles

### 1. Solve a Specific Problem
- Address one clear pain point, not a broad topic
- "How to write cold emails that get replies" > "Marketing guide"

### 2. Match the Buyer Stage
- Awareness leads need education
- Consideration leads need comparison and evaluation
- Decision leads need implementation help

### 3. High Perceived Value, Low Time Investment
- Should look like it's worth paying for
- Consumable in under 30 minutes (ideally under 10)
- Immediate, actionable takeaway

### 4. Natural Path to Product
- Solves a problem your product also solves
- Creates awareness of a gap your product fills
- Demonstrates your expertise in the space

### 5. Easy to Consume
- One clear format (don't mix ebook + video + spreadsheet)
- Works on mobile
- No special software required

## Matching Lead Magnets to Buyer Stage

### Awareness Stage
Goal: Educate on the problem. Attract people who don't know you yet.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Checklist | "10-Point Website Audit Checklist" |
| Cheat sheet | "SEO Cheat Sheet for Beginners" |
| Ebook/guide | "The Complete Guide to Email Marketing" |
| Quiz | "What Type of Marketer Are You?" |

### Consideration Stage
Goal: Help evaluate solutions. Build trust and demonstrate expertise.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Comparison template | "CRM Comparison Spreadsheet" |
| Assessment | "Marketing Maturity Assessment" |
| Case study collection | "5 Companies That 3x'd Their Pipeline" |
| Webinar | "How to Choose the Right Analytics Tool" |

### Decision Stage
Goal: Help implement. Remove friction to purchase.

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Template | "Ready-to-Use Sales Email Templates" |
| Free trial | "14-Day Free Trial" |
| Implementation guide | "Migration Checklist: Switch in 30 Minutes" |
| ROI calculator | "Calculate Your Savings" (→ see **free-tools**) |

---

## Gating Strategy

### Gating Options

| Approach | When to Use | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Full gate** | High-value content, bottom-funnel | Max capture, lower reach |
| **Partial gate** | Preview + full version | Balance of reach and capture |
| **Ungated + optional** | Top-funnel education | Max reach, lower capture |
| **Content upgrade** | Blog post + bonus | Contextual, high-intent |

### What to Ask For

- **Email only** — highest conversion, lowest friction
- **Email + name** — enables personalization, slight friction increase
- **Email + company/role** — better lead qualification, more friction
- **Multi-field** — only for high-value offers (webinars, demos)

Rule of thumb: Ask for the minimum needed. Every extra field reduces conversion by 5-10%.

### How to Frame the Exchange

- Make the value obvious: "Get the full 25-page guide free"
- Show a preview: table of contents, first page, sample results
- Add social proof: "Downloaded by 5,000+ marketers"
- Reduce risk: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."

**For form optimization**: See **cro** skill
**For popup implementation**: See **popups** skill

---

## Landing Page & Delivery

### Landing Page Structure

1. **Headline** — Clear benefit: what they'll get and why it matters
2. **Preview/mockup** — Visual of the lead magnet (cover, screenshot, sample page)
3. **What's inside** — 3-5 bullet points of key takeaways
4. **Social proof** — Download count, testimonials, logos
5. **Form** — Minimal fields, clear CTA button
6. **FAQ** — Address hesitations (Is it really free? What format?)

**For landing page optimization**: See **cro** skill

### Delivery Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Instant download** | Immediate gratification | No email verification |
| **Email delivery** | Verifies email, starts relationship | Slight delay |
| **Thank you page + email** | Best of both—instant access + email copy | Slightly more complex |
| **Drip delivery** | Builds habit, multiple touchpoints | Only for courses/series |

### Thank You Page Optimization

Don't waste the thank you page. After they've converted:
- Confirm delivery ("Check your inbox")
- Offer a next step (book a demo, start trial, join community)
- Share on social (pre-written tweet/post)
- Recommend related content

---

## Promotion & Distribution

### Blog CTAs & Content Upgrades

- Add relevant CTAs within blog posts (inline, end-of-post)
- Create post-specific content upgrades (bonus checklist for a how-to post)
- Content upgrades convert 2-5x better than generic sidebar CTAs

### Exit-Intent & Popups

- Trigger on exit intent or scroll depth
- Match the popup offer to the page content
- **See popups** for implementation

### Social Media

- Share snippets and teasers from the lead magnet
- Create carousel posts from key points
- Use the lead magnet as the CTA in your bio/profile
- **See social** for social strategy

### Paid Promotion

- Facebook/Instagram lead ads for top-funnel lead magnets
- Google Ads for high-intent lead magnets (templates, tools)
- LinkedIn for B2B lead magnets
- Retarget blog visitors with lead magnet ads
- **See ads** for campaign strategy

### Partner Co-Promotion

- Cross-promote with complementary brands
- Guest webinars with partner audiences
- Include in partner newsletters
- Bundle in resource collections

## Ebooks & Guides

**Best for**: Building authority, deep education, awareness-stage leads

**Structure**:
1. Title page with professional design
2. Table of contents
3. Introduction — frame the problem, set expectations
4. 3-7 chapters — one key concept per chapter
5. Summary — recap key takeaways
6. CTA — next step toward your product

**Guidelines**:
- Ideal length: 10-25 pages (shorter is fine if valuable)
- Include visuals: charts, diagrams, screenshots
- Use callout boxes for key stats or quotes
- End each chapter with a quick takeaway
- Don't pad — density beats length

**Tools**: Canva, Google Docs → PDF, Notion export, Designrr, Beacon.by

---

## Checklists

**Best for**: Process-oriented tasks, quick wins, implementation help

**Structure**:
- Title: "[Number]-Point [Topic] Checklist"
- Numbered or checkbox items
- Group into logical sections if 10+ items
- Brief explanation per item (1-2 sentences)

**Guidelines**:
- Keep to 1-2 pages
- Use actionable language ("Verify X", "Set up Y", "Remove Z")
- Order by workflow sequence or priority
- Make it printable — clean layout, generous spacing
- Include a "done" checkbox for each item

**What works**: Step-by-step processes, audit criteria, launch checklists, setup guides

---

## Cheat Sheets

**Best for**: Reference material, shortcuts, quick-lookup information

**Structure**:
- One page (two pages max)
- Organized by category or workflow
- Dense but scannable
- Visual hierarchy with headers and grouping

**Guidelines**:
- Optimize for quick reference, not reading
- Use tables, grids, or columns
- Include formulas, shortcuts, or code snippets
- Design for printing or saving as desktop reference
- Bold the most important items

**What works**: Keyboard shortcuts, formula references, terminology glossaries, decision matrices

---

## Templates & Spreadsheets

**Best for**: Repeatable processes, planning, tracking

### Spreadsheet Templates (Google Sheets / Excel)
- Include a "How to Use" tab with instructions
- Pre-fill with example data
- Use data validation for dropdown fields
- Add conditional formatting for visual cues
- Lock formula cells, leave input cells editable
- Include a "Make a Copy" link (Google Sheets)

### Notion Templates
- Provide a duplicate link
- Include a getting-started guide
- Pre-populate with example content
- Use Notion's database features (views, filters, relations)
- Keep it simple — don't over-engineer

### Document Templates
- Provide in multiple formats (Google Doc, Word, PDF)
- Include placeholder text with [BRACKETS] for customization
- Add inline instructions in a different color
- Make it immediately usable with minimal editing

**Key principle**: Templates should be usable within 5 minutes of downloading.

---

## Swipe Files

**Best for**: Inspiration, examples, learning from others

**Structure**:
- Curated collection of 15-50 examples
- Organized by category, type, or use case
- Each example includes:
  - The example itself (screenshot, text, link)
  - Why it works (2-3 bullet annotations)
  - How to adapt it (1-2 sentences)

**Guidelines**:
- Quality over quantity — curate ruthlessly
- Add your analysis, don't just collect
- Organize for browsing (categories, tags)
- Update periodically with fresh examples
- Credit original sources

**What works**: Email subject lines, landing pages, ad copy, CTAs, onboarding flows, pricing pages

---

## Mini-Courses

### Email-Based Mini-Courses
- 3-5 emails delivered over 5-7 days
- One lesson per email, one concept per lesson
- Each email: teach → example → exercise
- Progressive difficulty (build on previous lessons)
- Final email: summary + CTA for product or next step

### Video-Based Mini-Courses
- 3-5 videos, 5-15 minutes each
- Host on unlisted YouTube, Loom, or course platform
- Deliver links via email drip
- Include worksheets or exercises per lesson
- More personal — builds stronger connection

**Cadence**: Every 1-2 days. Don't stretch too thin or compress too tight.

**Key principle**: Each lesson should deliver standalone value. If someone only watches lesson 2, they should still learn something useful.

---

## Quizzes & Assessments

**Best for**: Engagement, segmentation, personalized results

**Question Design**:
- 5-10 questions (sweet spot: 7)
- Multiple choice only — no open-ended
- Questions should feel insightful, not obvious
- Progress indicator ("Question 3 of 7")

**Result Segmentation**:
- 3-5 result categories
- Each result: name, description, personalized recommendations
- Tailor follow-up emails by result type
- Share-worthy result format ("I got: Growth Stage Marketer!")

**Implementation**: Gate results behind email capture. The quiz itself is ungated — the personalized results require an email.

**For building interactive quizzes**: See **free-tools** skill for technical implementation guidance.

---

## Webinars & Workshops

### Live Webinars
- 30-45 minutes teaching + 15 minutes Q&A
- Structure: Hook → Teach (3 key points) → Demo/example → CTA
- Promote 1-2 weeks in advance
- Send 3 reminder emails (confirmation, day before, 1 hour before)
- Record for replay (extends value)

### Evergreen Webinars
- Pre-recorded, available on demand
- Same structure as live but tighter editing
- Always-on lead generation
- Gate with email registration
- Automated follow-up sequence

**Follow-up**: Send replay link + summary + CTA within 24 hours. Continue with nurture sequence.

**Key principle**: Teach something genuinely useful. A webinar that's just a sales pitch will damage trust.
