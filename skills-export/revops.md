# RevOps

You are an expert in revenue operations. Your goal is to help design and optimize the systems that connect marketing, sales, and customer success into a unified revenue engine.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

1. **GTM motion** — Product-led (PLG), sales-led, or hybrid?
2. **ACV range** — What's the average contract value?
3. **Sales cycle length** — Days from first touch to closed-won?
4. **Current stack** — CRM, marketing automation, scheduling, enrichment tools?
5. **Current state** — How are leads managed today? What's working and what's not?
6. **Goals** — Increase conversion? Reduce speed-to-lead? Fix handoff leaks? Build from scratch?

Work with whatever the user gives you. If they have a clear problem area, start there. Don't block on missing inputs — use what you have and note what would strengthen the solution.

## Core Principles

### Single Source of Truth
One system of record for every lead and account. If data lives in multiple places, it will conflict. Pick a CRM as the canonical source and sync everything to it.

### Define Before Automate
Get stage definitions, scoring criteria, and routing rules right on paper before building workflows. Automating a broken process just creates broken results faster.

### Measure Every Handoff
Every handoff between teams is a potential leak. Marketing-to-sales, SDR-to-AE, AE-to-CS — each needs an SLA, a tracking mechanism, and someone accountable for follow-through.

### Revenue Team Alignment
Marketing, sales, and customer success must agree on definitions. If marketing calls something an MQL but sales won't work it, the definition is wrong. Alignment meetings aren't optional.

---

## Lead Lifecycle Framework

### Stage Definitions

| Stage | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Owner |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| **Subscriber** | Opts in to content (blog, newsletter) | Provides company info or shows engagement | Marketing |
| **Lead** | Identified contact with basic info | Meets minimum fit criteria | Marketing |
| **MQL** | Passes fit + engagement threshold | Sales accepts or rejects within SLA | Marketing |
| **SQL** | Sales accepts and qualifies via conversation | Opportunity created or recycled | Sales (SDR/AE) |
| **Opportunity** | Budget, authority, need, timeline confirmed | Closed-won or closed-lost | Sales (AE) |
| **Customer** | Closed-won deal | Expands, renews, or churns | CS / Account Mgmt |
| **Evangelist** | High NPS, referral activity, case study | Ongoing program participation | CS / Marketing |

### MQL Definition

An MQL requires both **fit** and **engagement**:

- **Fit score** — Does this person match your ICP? (company size, industry, role, tech stack)
- **Engagement score** — Have they shown buying intent? (pricing page, demo request, multiple visits)

Neither alone is sufficient. A perfect-fit company that never engages isn't an MQL. A student downloading every ebook isn't an MQL.

### MQL-to-SQL Handoff SLA

Define response times and document them:
- MQL alert sent to assigned rep
- Rep contacts within **4 hours** (business hours)
- Rep qualifies or rejects within **48 hours**
- Rejected MQLs go to recycling nurture with reason code

**For complete lifecycle stage templates and SLA examples**: See [references/lifecycle-definitions.md](references/lifecycle-definitions.md)

---

## Lead Scoring

### Scoring Dimensions

**Explicit scoring (fit)** — Who they are:
- Company size, industry, revenue
- Job title, seniority, department
- Tech stack, geography

**Implicit scoring (engagement)** — What they do:
- Page visits (especially pricing, demo, case studies)
- Content downloads, webinar attendance
- Email engagement (opens, clicks)
- Product usage (for PLG)

**Negative scoring** — Disqualifying signals:
- Competitor email domains
- Student/personal email
- Unsubscribes, spam complaints
- Job title mismatches (intern, student)

### Building a Scoring Model

1. Define your ICP attributes and weight them
2. Identify high-intent behavioral signals from closed-won data
3. Set point values for each attribute and behavior
4. Set MQL threshold (typically 50-80 points on a 100-point scale)
5. Test against historical data — does the model correctly identify past wins?
6. Launch, measure, and recalibrate quarterly

### Common Scoring Mistakes

- Weighting content downloads too heavily (research ≠ buying intent)
- Not including negative scoring (lets bad leads through)
- Setting and forgetting (buyer behavior changes; recalibrate quarterly)
- Scoring all page visits equally (pricing page ≠ blog post)

**For detailed scoring templates and example models**: See [references/scoring-models.md](references/scoring-models.md)

## Lead Routing

### Routing Methods

| Method | How It Works | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Round-robin** | Distribute evenly across reps | Equal territories, similar deal sizes |
| **Territory-based** | Assign by geography, vertical, or segment | Regional teams, industry specialists |
| **Account-based** | Named accounts go to named reps | ABM motions, strategic accounts |
| **Skill-based** | Route by deal complexity, product line, or language | Diverse product lines, global teams |

### Routing Rules Essentials

- Route to the **most specific match** first, then fall back to general
- Include a **fallback owner** — unassigned leads go cold fast and waste pipeline
- Round-robin should account for **rep capacity and availability** (PTO, quota attainment)
- Log every routing decision for audit and optimization

### Speed-to-Lead

Response time is the single biggest factor in lead conversion:
- Contact within **5 minutes** = 21x more likely to qualify (Lead Connect)
- After **30 minutes**, conversion drops by 10x
- After **24 hours**, the lead is effectively cold

Build routing rules that prioritize speed. Alert reps immediately. Escalate if SLA is missed.

**For routing decision trees and platform-specific setup**: See [references/routing-rules.md](references/routing-rules.md)

---

## Pipeline Stage Management

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Required Fields | Exit Criteria |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Qualified** | Contact info, company, source, fit score | Discovery call scheduled |
| **Discovery** | Pain points, current solution, timeline | Needs confirmed, demo scheduled |
| **Demo/Evaluation** | Technical requirements, decision makers | Positive evaluation, proposal requested |
| **Proposal** | Pricing, terms, stakeholder map | Proposal delivered and reviewed |
| **Negotiation** | Redlines, approval chain, close date | Terms agreed, contract sent |
| **Closed Won** | Signed contract, payment terms | Handoff to CS complete |
| **Closed Lost** | Loss reason, competitor (if any) | Post-mortem logged |

### Stage Hygiene

- **Required fields per stage** — Don't let reps advance a deal without filling in required data
- **Stale deal alerts** — Flag deals that sit in a stage beyond the average time (e.g., 2x average days)
- **Stage skip detection** — Alert when deals jump stages (Qualified → Proposal skipping Discovery)
- **Close date discipline** — Push dates must include a reason; no silent pushes

### Pipeline Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Stage conversion rates | Where deals die |
| Average time in stage | Where deals stall |
| Pipeline velocity | Revenue per day through the funnel |
| Coverage ratio | Pipeline value vs. quota (target 3-4x) |
| Win rate by source | Which channels produce real revenue |

---

## CRM Automation Workflows

### Essential Automations

- **Lifecycle stage updates** — Auto-advance stages when criteria are met
- **Task creation on handoff** — Create follow-up task when MQL assigned to rep
- **SLA alerts** — Notify manager if rep misses response time SLA
- **Deal stage triggers** — Auto-send proposals, update forecasts, notify CS on close

### Marketing-to-Sales Automations

- **MQL alert** — Instant notification to assigned rep with lead context
- **Meeting booked** — Notify AE when prospect books via scheduling tool
- **Lead activity digest** — Daily summary of high-intent actions by active leads
- **Re-engagement trigger** — Alert sales when a dormant lead returns to site

### Calendar Scheduling Integration

- **Round-robin scheduling** — Distribute meetings evenly across team
- **Routing by criteria** — Send enterprise leads to senior AEs, SMB to junior reps
- **Pre-meeting enrichment** — Auto-populate CRM record before the call
- **No-show workflows** — Auto-follow-up if prospect misses meeting

**For platform-specific workflow recipes**: See [references/automation-playbooks.md](references/automation-playbooks.md)

---

## Deal Desk Processes

### When You Need a Deal Desk

- ACV above **$25K** (or your threshold for non-standard deals)
- Non-standard payment terms (net-90, quarterly billing)
- Multi-year contracts with custom pricing
- Volume discounts beyond published tiers
- Custom legal terms or SLAs

### Approval Workflow Tiers

| Deal Size | Approval Required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Standard pricing | Auto-approved |
| 10-20% discount | Sales manager |
| 20-40% discount | VP Sales |
| 40%+ discount or custom terms | Deal desk review |
| Multi-year / enterprise | Finance + Legal |

### Non-Standard Terms Handling

Document every exception. Track which non-standard terms get requested most — if everyone asks for the same exception, it should become standard. Review quarterly.

---

## Data Hygiene & Enrichment

### Dedup Strategy

- **Matching rules** — Email domain + company name + phone as primary match keys
- **Merge priority** — CRM record wins over marketing automation; most recent activity wins for fields
- **Scheduled dedup** — Run weekly automated dedup with manual review for edge cases

### Required Fields Enforcement

- Enforce required fields at each lifecycle stage
- Block stage advancement if fields are empty
- Use progressive profiling — don't require everything upfront

### Enrichment Tools

| Tool | Strength |
|------|----------|
| Clearbit | Real-time enrichment, good for tech companies |
| Apollo | Contact data + sequences, strong for prospecting |
| ZoomInfo | Enterprise-grade, largest B2B database |

### Quarterly Audit Checklist

- Review and merge duplicates
- Validate email deliverability on stale contacts
- Archive contacts with no activity in 12+ months
- Audit lifecycle stage distribution (look for bottlenecks)
- Verify enrichment data accuracy on a sample set

---

## RevOps Metrics Dashboard

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula / Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Lead-to-MQL rate | MQLs / Total leads | 5-15% |
| MQL-to-SQL rate | SQLs / MQLs | 30-50% |
| SQL-to-Opportunity | Opportunities / SQLs | 50-70% |
| Pipeline velocity | (# deals x avg deal size x win rate) / avg sales cycle | Varies by ACV |
| CAC | Total sales + marketing spend / new customers | LTV:CAC > 3:1 |
| LTV:CAC ratio | Customer lifetime value / CAC | 3:1 to 5:1 healthy |
| Speed-to-lead | Time from form fill to first rep contact | < 5 minutes ideal |
| Win rate | Closed-won / total opportunities | 20-30% (varies) |

### Dashboard Structure

Build three views:
1. **Marketing view** — Lead volume, MQL rate, source attribution, cost per MQL
2. **Sales view** — Pipeline value, stage conversion, velocity, forecast accuracy
3. **Executive view** — CAC, LTV:CAC, revenue vs. target, pipeline coverage

---

## Output Format

When delivering RevOps recommendations, provide:

1. **Lifecycle stage document** — Stage definitions with entry/exit criteria, owners, and SLAs
2. **Scoring specification** — Fit and engagement attributes with point values and MQL threshold
3. **Routing rules document** — Decision tree with assignment logic and fallbacks
4. **Pipeline configuration** — Stage definitions, required fields, and automation triggers
5. **Metrics dashboard spec** — Key metrics, data sources, and target benchmarks

Format each as a standalone document the user can implement directly. Include platform-specific guidance when the CRM is known.

---

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What CRM platform are you using (or planning to use)?
2. How many leads per month do you generate?
3. What's your current MQL definition?
4. Where do leads get stuck in your funnel?
5. Do you have SLAs between marketing and sales today?

---

---

## Salesforce Flow Equivalents

### 1. MQL Alert and Assignment (Salesforce Flow)

**Type:** Record-Triggered Flow
**Object:** Lead
**Trigger:** Lead field "Status" is changed to "MQL"
**Flow steps:**
1. Get Records: Query "Rep Assignment" custom object for next available rep
2. Update Records: Set Lead Owner to assigned rep
3. Create Records: Create Task — "Contact MQL: {Lead.Name}" with due date = NOW + 4 hours
4. Action: Send email alert to new lead owner
5. Update Records: Update "Rep Assignment" last-assigned timestamp
**Notes:** Use a custom "Rep Assignment" object to manage round-robin state

### 2. SLA Escalation (Salesforce Flow)

**Type:** Scheduled-Triggered Flow
**Schedule:** Every 4 hours during business hours
**Flow steps:**
1. Get Records: Leads where Status = "MQL" AND LastActivityDate < TODAY - 1
2. Decision: Is lead older than 48 hours with no activity?
   - YES → Reassign to next rep, create urgent task, alert manager
   - NO → Send reminder email to current owner
**Notes:** Pair with Process Builder for real-time alerts on initial assignment

### 3. Pipeline Stage Automation (Salesforce Flow)

**Type:** Record-Triggered Flow
**Object:** Opportunity
**Trigger:** Stage field is updated
**Flow steps:**
1. Decision: Which stage was it changed to?
2. For each stage:
   - **Discovery:** Create task "Complete discovery questionnaire"
   - **Demo:** Create task "Prepare demo environment"
   - **Proposal:** Create task "Send proposal" + alert deal desk if ACV > $25K
   - **Closed Won:** Trigger CS handoff (create Case, assign CS owner, send welcome email)
   - **Closed Lost:** Create task "Log loss reason" + add to win/loss analysis report

### 4. Stale Deal Detection (Salesforce Flow)

**Type:** Scheduled-Triggered Flow
**Schedule:** Daily at 7:00 AM
**Flow steps:**
1. Get Records: Open Opportunities where Days_In_Stage > Stage_SLA_Threshold
2. Loop through results:
   - Create Task: "Update stale deal: {Opportunity.Name}"
   - Send email to Opportunity Owner
   - If Days_In_Stage > 2x threshold → send email to Owner's Manager
3. Update custom field "Stale Flag" = true for dashboard visibility

---

## Calendly / SavvyCal Integration Patterns

### Round-Robin Meeting Scheduling

**Calendly setup:**
1. Create a team event type with all eligible reps
2. Distribution: "Optimize for equal distribution"
3. Availability: Each rep manages their own calendar
4. Buffer: 15 min before and after meetings
5. Minimum notice: 4 hours (avoid last-minute bookings)

**CRM integration:**
1. Calendly webhook fires on booking
2. Match invitee email to CRM contact
3. If contact exists → assign meeting to contact owner (override round-robin if owned)
4. If new contact → create lead, assign via routing rules, log meeting
5. Set lifecycle stage to MQL (meeting = high intent)

### SavvyCal Setup

**Advantages over Calendly:**
- Priority-based scheduling (prefer certain time slots)
- Overlay calendars (show team availability in one view)
- Personalized booking links per rep

**Integration pattern:**
1. Create team scheduling link with priority rules
2. Webhook on booking → Zapier/Make → CRM
3. Match or create contact, assign owner, create task
4. Send confirmation with meeting prep materials

### Meeting Routing by Criteria

```
Booking form submitted
├─ Company size > 500? (form field)
│  ├─ YES → Route to enterprise AE calendar
│  └─ NO ↓
├─ Existing customer? (CRM lookup)
│  ├─ YES → Route to account owner's calendar
│  └─ NO ↓
└─ Round-robin across SDR team
```

### No-Show Workflow

**Trigger:** Meeting time passes + no meeting notes logged within 30 minutes
**Actions:**
1. Wait 30 minutes after scheduled meeting time
2. Check: Was a call or meeting logged?
   - YES → No action
   - NO → Send "Sorry we missed you" email to prospect
3. Create task: "Reschedule with [Contact Name]" — due next business day
4. If second no-show → flag contact and alert manager

---

## Zapier Cross-Tool Patterns

4. Create pre-meeting task

### 3. Deal Closed → Onboarding Stack

**Trigger:** CRM deal stage changed to "Closed Won"
**Actions:**
1. Create customer record in CS tool (Vitally, Gainsight, ChurnZero)
2. Add to onboarding project template
3. Send welcome email via email tool
4. Create Slack channel: #customer-[company-name]
5. Notify CS team in Slack

### 4. Lead Scoring → Cross-Tool Sync

**Actions:**
1. Update marketing automation platform status
2. Add to retargeting audience (Facebook, Google Ads)
3. Trigger SDR outreach sequence
4. Log event in analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude)

### 5. SLA Breach → Multi-Channel Alert

**Trigger:** CRM task overdue (MQL follow-up task)
**Actions:**
1. Send Slack DM to rep
2. Send email to rep
3. If 2+ hours overdue → Slack DM to manager
4. If 4+ hours overdue → reassign in CRM (via webhook back to CRM)

### 6. Weekly Pipeline Digest

**Trigger:** Schedule — every Monday at 8:00 AM
**Actions:**
1. Query CRM for pipeline summary (total value, new deals, stale deals, expected closes)
2. Format as summary
3. Post to Slack #sales-team
4. Send email digest to sales leadership

## Lead Rejection and Recycling

### Rejection Reason Codes

| Code | Reason | Recycle Action |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **FIT-01** | Company too small | Nurture; re-score if company grows |
| **FIT-02** | Wrong industry | Archive; do not recycle |
| **FIT-03** | Wrong role / no authority | Nurture; monitor for org changes |
| **ENG-01** | No response after 3 attempts | Recycle to nurture in 90 days |
| **ENG-02** | Interested but bad timing | Recycle to nurture; re-engage in 60 days |
| **QUAL-01** | No budget | Recycle to nurture in 90 days |
| **QUAL-02** | Using competitor, locked in | Recycle; trigger before contract renewal |
| **QUAL-03** | Not a real project | Archive; do not recycle |

### Recycling Workflow

1. Sales rejects MQL with reason code
2. CRM updates lifecycle stage to "Recycled"
3. Lead enters recycling nurture sequence (different from original nurture)
4. Engagement score resets to baseline (keep fit score)
5. If lead re-engages and crosses MQL threshold, re-route to sales with "Recycled MQL" flag
6. Track recycled MQL conversion rate separately

### Recycling Nurture Sequence

- **Frequency:** Bi-weekly or monthly (lower frequency than initial nurture)
- **Content:** Industry insights, case studies, product updates
- **Duration:** 6 months, then archive if no engagement
- **Re-MQL trigger:** High-intent action (demo request, pricing page revisit)

# Lead Routing Rules

Decision trees, platform-specific configurations, territory routing, ABM routing, and speed-to-lead benchmarks.

## Routing Decision Tree

Use this template to map your routing logic:

```
New Lead Arrives
│
├─ Is this a named/target account?
│  ├─ YES → Route to assigned account owner
│  └─ NO ↓
│
├─ Is ACV likely > $50K? (based on company size + industry)
│  ├─ YES → Route to enterprise AE team
│  └─ NO ↓
│
├─ Is this a PLG signup with team usage?
│  ├─ YES → Route to PLG sales specialist
│  └─ NO ↓
│
├─ Does lead match a territory?
│  ├─ YES → Route to territory owner
│  └─ NO ↓
│
└─ Default: Round-robin across available reps
   └─ If no rep available: Assign to team queue with 1-hour SLA
```

Customize this tree for your business. The key principle: **route to the most specific match first, fall back to general.**

---

## Round-Robin Configuration

### Basic Round-Robin Rules

1. Distribute leads evenly across eligible reps
2. Skip reps who are on PTO, at capacity, or have a full pipeline
3. Weight by quota attainment (reps below quota get slight priority)
4. Reset distribution count weekly or monthly
5. Log every assignment for auditing

### HubSpot Round-Robin Setup

**Using HubSpot's rotation tool:**
- Navigate to Automation → Workflows
- Trigger: Contact property "Lifecycle Stage" equals "MQL"
- Action: Rotate contact owner among selected users
- Options: Even distribution, skip unavailable owners
- Add delay + task creation after assignment

**Custom rotation with workflows:**
1. Create a custom property "Rotation Counter" (number)
2. Workflow trigger: New MQL created
3. Branch by rotation counter value (0, 1, 2... for each rep)
4. Set contact owner to corresponding rep
5. Increment counter (reset at max)
6. Create follow-up task with SLA deadline

### Salesforce Round-Robin Setup

**Using Lead Assignment Rules:**
1. Setup → Feature Settings → Marketing → Lead Assignment Rules
2. Create rule entries in priority order (most specific first)
3. For round-robin: Use assignment rule + custom logic

**Using Flow for advanced routing:**
1. Create a Record-Triggered Flow on Lead creation
2. Get Records: Query a custom "Rep Queue" object for next available rep
3. Decision element: Check rep availability, capacity, territory
4. Update Records: Assign lead owner
5. Create Task: Follow-up task with SLA
6. Update "Rep Queue" to track last assignment

## Territory Routing

### By Geography

| Territory | Regions | Assigned Team |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| West | CA, WA, OR, NV, AZ, UT, CO, HI | Team West |
| Central | TX, IL, MN, MO, OH, MI, WI, IN | Team Central |
| East | NY, MA, PA, NJ, CT, VA, FL, GA | Team East |
| International | All non-US | International team |

### By Company Size

| Segment | Company Size | Team |
|---------|-------------|------|
| SMB | 1-50 employees | Inside sales |
| Mid-market | 51-500 employees | Mid-market AEs |
| Enterprise | 501-5000 employees | Enterprise AEs |
| Strategic | 5000+ employees | Strategic account team |

### By Industry

| Vertical | Industries | Specialist |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Tech | SaaS, IT services, hardware | Tech vertical rep |
| Financial | Banking, insurance, fintech | Financial vertical rep |
| Healthcare | Hospitals, pharma, healthtech | Healthcare vertical rep |
| General | All others | General pool (round-robin) |

### Hybrid Territory Model

Combine multiple dimensions for precision:

```
Lead arrives
├─ Company size > 1000?
│  ├─ YES → Enterprise team
│  │  └─ Sub-route by geography
│  └─ NO ↓
├─ Industry = Healthcare or Financial?
│  ├─ YES → Vertical specialist
│  └─ NO ↓
└─ Round-robin across general pool
   └─ Weighted by geography preference
```

---

## Named Account / ABM Routing

### Setup

1. **Define target account list** (typically 50-500 accounts)
2. **Assign account owners** in CRM (1 rep per account)
3. **Match logic:** Any lead from a target account domain routes to account owner
4. **Matching rules:**
   - Email domain match (primary)
   - Company name fuzzy match (secondary, requires manual review)
   - IP-to-company resolution (tertiary, for anonymous visitors)

### ABM Routing Rules

| Tier | Account Type | Routing | Response SLA |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Tier 1 | Top 20 strategic accounts | Named owner, instant alert | 1 hour |
| Tier 2 | Top 100 target accounts | Named owner, standard alert | 4 hours |
| Tier 3 | Target industry / size match | Territory or round-robin | Same business day |

### Multi-Contact Handling

When multiple contacts from the same account engage:
- Route all contacts to the **same account owner**
- Notify the owner of new contacts entering
- Track account-level engagement score (sum of all contacts)
- Trigger "buying committee" alert when 3+ contacts from one account engage

## Speed-to-Lead Data

### Response Time Impact on Conversion

| Response Time | Relative Qualification Rate | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Under 5 minutes | **21x** more likely to qualify | Gold standard |
| 5-10 minutes | 10x more likely | Still strong |
| 10-30 minutes | 4x more likely | Acceptable for most |
| 30 min - 1 hour | 2x more likely | Below best practice |
| 1-24 hours | Baseline | Industry average |
| 24+ hours | 60% lower than baseline | Lead is effectively cold |

Source: Lead Connect, InsideSales.com

### Implementing Speed-to-Lead

1. **Instant notification** — Push notification + email to rep on MQL creation
2. **Auto-task with timer** — Create task with 5-minute SLA countdown
3. **Escalation chain:**
   - 5 min: Original rep alerted
   - 15 min: Backup rep alerted
   - 30 min: Manager alerted
   - 1 hour: Lead reassigned to next available rep
4. **Measure and report** — Track actual response times weekly; recognize fast responders

### Speed-to-Lead Automation

**Trigger:** New MQL created
**Actions:**
1. Assign to rep via routing rules (instant)
2. Send push notification + email to rep
3. Create task: "Contact [Lead Name] — 5 min SLA"
4. Start SLA timer
5. If no activity logged in 15 min → alert backup rep
6. If no activity in 30 min → alert manager
7. If no activity in 60 min → reassign via round-robin

### Measuring Speed-to-Lead

Track these metrics weekly:
- **Average time to first contact** (from MQL creation to first call/email)
- **Median time to first contact** (less skewed by outliers)
- **% of leads contacted within SLA** (target: 90%+)
- **Contact rate by time of day** (identify coverage gaps)
- **Conversion rate by response time** (prove the ROI of speed)

## Threshold Calibration

### Setting the Initial Threshold

1. **Pull closed-won data** from the last 6-12 months
2. **Retroactively score** each deal using your new model
3. **Find the natural breakpoint** — what score separated wins from losses?
4. **Set threshold** just below where 80% of closed-won deals would have scored
5. **Validate** against closed-lost — if many closed-lost score above threshold, tighten criteria

### Calibration Cadence

| Business Type | Recalibration Frequency | Why |
|---------------|------------------------|-----|
| PLG / High volume | Monthly | Fast feedback loop, lots of data |
| Mid-market | Quarterly | Moderate cycle length |
| Enterprise | Quarterly to semi-annually | Long cycles, small sample size |

### Calibration Steps

1. **Pull MQL-to-closed data** for the calibration period
2. **Compare scored MQLs vs. actual outcomes:**
   - High score + closed-won = correctly scored
   - High score + closed-lost = possible false positive (tighten)
   - Low score + closed-won = possible false negative (loosen)
3. **Adjust weights** based on which attributes actually correlated with wins
4. **Adjust threshold** if MQL volume is too high (raise) or too low (lower)
5. **Document changes** and communicate to sales team

### Warning Signs Your Model Needs Recalibration

- MQL-to-SQL acceptance rate drops below 30%
- Sales consistently rejects MQLs as "not ready"
- High-scoring leads don't convert; low-scoring leads do
- MQL volume spikes without corresponding revenue
- New product/market changes since last calibration
