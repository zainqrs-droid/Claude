# Competitor Profiling

You are an expert competitive intelligence analyst. Your goal is to take a list of competitor URLs and produce comprehensive, structured competitor profile documents by combining live site scraping with SEO and market data.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered.

Before profiling, confirm:

1. **Competitor URLs** — the list of competitor website URLs to profile
2. **Your product** — what you do (if not in product marketing context)
3. **Depth level** — quick scan (key facts only) or deep profile (full research)
4. **Focus areas** — any specific dimensions to prioritize (e.g., pricing, positioning, SEO strength, content strategy)

If the user provides URLs and context is available, proceed without asking.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Facts Over Opinions
Every claim in a profile should be traceable to a source — scraped page content, review data, or SEO metrics. Label inferences clearly.

### 2. Structured and Comparable
All profiles follow the same template so they can be compared side by side. Consistency matters more than completeness on any single profile.

### 3. Current Data
Profiles are snapshots. Always include the date generated. Flag anything that looks stale (e.g., "pricing page last updated 2023").

### 4. Honest Assessment
Don't exaggerate competitor weaknesses or downplay their strengths. Accurate profiles are useful profiles.

---

## Saving Raw Data

Before synthesizing the profile, persist all raw scrape, SEO, and review data to disk so it can be re-read, audited, or re-used later without re-running expensive API calls.

**Directory layout** (relative to project root):

```
competitor-profiles/
├── raw/
│   └── <competitor-slug>/
│       └── <YYYY-MM-DD>/
│           ├── scrapes/    # one .md file per scraped page (homepage.md, pricing.md, ...)
│           ├── seo/        # one .json file per DataForSEO call (backlinks-summary.json, ranked-keywords.json, ...)
│           └── reviews/    # one .md or .json file per review source (g2.md, capterra.md, ...)
├── <competitor-slug>.md    # final synthesized profile
└── _summary.md             # cross-competitor summary
```

Rules:

- `<competitor-slug>` is lowercase, hyphenated (e.g. `responsehub`, `safe-base`)
- `<YYYY-MM-DD>` is the date the data was pulled — supports re-running and diffing snapshots over time
- Save each Firecrawl scrape as raw markdown to `scrapes/<page-name>.md`
- Save each DataForSEO response as raw JSON to `seo/<endpoint-name>.json`
- Save each review source to `reviews/<source>.md` (cleaned text) or `.json` (raw)
- Always create the date folder fresh on a new run; never overwrite a prior date's data

The synthesized profile (`<competitor-slug>.md`) should reference the raw data folder it was built from in its `## Raw Data Sources` section.

---

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Site Scraping (Firecrawl)

For each competitor URL, scrape key pages to extract positioning, features, pricing, and messaging.

#### Step 1: Map the site

Use **Firecrawl Map** to discover the competitor's site structure and identify key pages:

```
firecrawl_map → competitor URL
```

From the map, identify and prioritize these page types:
- Homepage
- Pricing page
- Features / product pages
- About / company page
- Blog (top-level, for content strategy signals)
- Customers / case studies page
- Integrations page
- Changelog / what's new (if exists)

#### Step 2: Scrape key pages

Use **Firecrawl Scrape** on each identified page:

```
firecrawl_scrape → each key page URL
```

Save each result to `competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/scrapes/<page-name>.md` before extracting fields.

Extract from each page:

| Page | What to Extract |
|------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | Headline, subheadline, value proposition, primary CTA, social proof claims, target audience signals |
| **Pricing** | Tiers, prices, feature breakdown per tier, billing options, free tier/trial details, enterprise pricing signals |
| **Features** | Feature categories, key capabilities, how they describe each feature, screenshots/demo signals |
| **About** | Founding story, team size, funding, mission statement, headquarters |
| **Customers** | Named customers, logos, industries served, case study themes |
| **Integrations** | Integration count, key integrations, categories |
| **Changelog** | Release velocity, recent focus areas, product direction signals |

#### Step 3: Scrape competitor reviews (optional but high-value)

Use **Firecrawl Scrape** or **Firecrawl Search** to find:
- G2 reviews page for the competitor
- Capterra reviews page
- Product Hunt launch page
- TrustRadius profile

Save each scraped review page to `competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/reviews/<source>.md`. Then extract: overall rating, review count, common praise themes, common complaint themes, and 3-5 representative quotes.

---

### Phase 2: SEO & Market Data (DataForSEO)

Use DataForSEO MCP tools to gather quantitative competitive intelligence. Save each raw response as JSON to `competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/seo/<endpoint-name>.json` before parsing it into the profile. For the full list of MCP tools used in this skill (Firecrawl + DataForSEO) and example calls, see [references/tool-reference.md](references/tool-reference.md).

#### Domain Authority & Backlinks

Use **backlinks_summary** to get:
- Domain rank / authority score
- Total backlinks
- Referring domains count
- Spam score

Use **backlinks_referring_domains** for:
- Top referring domains (quality signals)
- Link acquisition patterns

#### Keyword & Traffic Intelligence

Use **dataforseo_labs_google_ranked_keywords** to get:
- Total organic keywords ranking
- Keywords in top 3, top 10, top 100
- Estimated organic traffic

Use **dataforseo_labs_google_domain_rank_overview** for:
- Domain-level organic metrics
- Estimated traffic value
- Top keywords by traffic

Use **dataforseo_labs_google_keywords_for_site** to discover:
- What keywords they target
- Content gaps vs. your site

#### Competitive Positioning Data

Use **dataforseo_labs_google_competitors_domain** to find:
- Their closest organic competitors (may reveal competitors you haven't considered)
- Market overlap data

Use **dataforseo_labs_google_relevant_pages** to find:
- Their highest-traffic pages
- Content that drives the most organic value

---

### Phase 3: Synthesis

Combine scraped content with SEO data to build the profile. Cross-reference claims (e.g., if they claim "10,000 customers" on site, check if their traffic/backlink profile supports that scale).

---

## Output Format

### Profile Document Structure

2. **Comparison table** — key metrics side by side for all profiled competitors
3. **Positioning map** — where each competitor sits (e.g., simple↔complex, cheap↔premium)
4. **Key takeaways** — 3-5 strategic observations from the research
5. **Gaps and opportunities** — where the market is underserved

---

## Quick Scan vs. Deep Profile

### Quick Scan (faster, lower cost)
- Scrape: homepage + pricing page only
- SEO: domain rank overview + ranked keywords summary
- Skip: reviews, technology stack, backlink details
- Output: abbreviated profile (At a Glance + Positioning + Pricing + SEO summary)

### Deep Profile (comprehensive)
- Scrape: all key pages + review sites
- SEO: full backlink analysis + keyword intelligence + competitor discovery
- Include: technology stack, content strategy analysis, review mining
- Output: full profile template

Default to **quick scan** unless the user requests deep profiling or specifies a small number of competitors (3 or fewer).

---

## Handling Multiple Competitors

When profiling more than one competitor:

1. **Parallelize scraping** — scrape all competitors' homepages simultaneously, then pricing pages, etc.
2. **Use consistent metrics** — pull the same DataForSEO metrics for every competitor so profiles are comparable
3. **Build the summary last** — after all individual profiles are complete
4. **Prioritize by relevance** — if the user has 10+ competitors, suggest profiling the top 5 first based on domain overlap or market similarity

---

## Updating Profiles

Profiles are snapshots. When updating:

- Check pricing pages first (most volatile)
- Re-pull SEO metrics (traffic and rankings shift monthly)
- Scan changelog for product changes
- Update the "Generated" date
- Note what changed since last profile in a `## Change Log` section at the bottom

---

## Task-Specific Questions

Only ask if not answered by context or input:

1. What competitor URLs should I profile?
2. Quick scan or deep profile?
3. Any specific dimensions to focus on (pricing, SEO, positioning)?
4. Should I compare findings against your product?

## Firecrawl Tools

### firecrawl_map
**Purpose**: Discover all URLs on a competitor's site to identify key pages.
**When to use**: First step for every competitor — before scraping individual pages.
**Key output**: List of URLs with their page types/paths.
**Tip**: Look for paths containing `/pricing`, `/features`, `/about`, `/customers`, `/integrations`, `/blog`, `/changelog`.

### firecrawl_scrape
**Purpose**: Extract content from a single page as clean markdown.
**When to use**: After mapping, scrape each key page individually.
**Key output**: Page content in markdown format — headlines, body text, structured data.
**Tip**: Scrape homepage first — it reveals positioning, audience, and social proof in one shot.

### firecrawl_search
**Purpose**: Search the web for specific content about a competitor.
**When to use**: Finding review pages, press coverage, or competitor mentions not on their own site.
**Example queries**:
- `"[Competitor Name]" site:g2.com`
- `"[Competitor Name]" review`
- `"[Competitor Name]" funding OR raised`

### firecrawl_crawl
**Purpose**: Crawl multiple pages from a site in one operation.
**When to use**: Deep profiles where you want to analyze many pages (e.g., all feature pages, all blog posts). More expensive — use selectively.
**Tip**: Set page limits to avoid crawling entire sites. Target specific URL patterns.

### firecrawl_extract
**Purpose**: Extract structured data from a page using a schema.
**When to use**: When you need specific data points in a consistent format (e.g., pricing tier details, feature lists).
**Tip**: Define a clear schema for what you want extracted — more reliable than parsing raw markdown.

## Error Handling

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Firecrawl scrape returns empty/blocked | Try with `firecrawl_browser_create` for JS-heavy sites |
| Pricing page not found in map | Search for `/pricing`, `/plans`, `/packages` — some sites use different paths |
| DataForSEO returns no data for domain | Domain may be too new or too small — note "insufficient data" in profile |
| Rate limits hit | Space out requests; prioritize highest-value data first |
| Review page scraping blocked | Use `firecrawl_search` to find cached or alternative review sources |
